**Hello friends 💙**
===================

There exists a common problem when training machine learning algorithms.

They often choose the first *good* solution that works, instead of the *best* solution.

Learning about this problem - and its fixes - have taught me to choose decisions which make me happier.

👑 The Queen needs a castle
==========================

*(Imagine)* you’re a powerful queen.

You require new land to build your castle which must be on the highest hill possible. 

This is your terrain:

Easy, right?

**Unfortunately, you’re also blind.**

The only way to judge the height is by feeling whether your next step is onto higher or lower ground.

🚶‍♀️ The Queen starts her journey
=================================

You prefer the left, so you head towards Spot A.

At some point, you feel your next step is lower. Maybe it’s just uneven terrain, so you keep going.

Your foot slips and you tumble down.

You stop at the bottom, bruised and broken.

![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/pic3-1.jpeg)You realise this isn’t even a hill! Annoyed and humiliated, you realise this was the worst path. So you retrace your steps, heading to Spot B.

🏰 The Queen finds her castle
============================

At some point, your next step is higher!

After, the previous fall - you’re thrilled at this discovery.

You gain a second wind and march to the top:

![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/pic2-2.jpeg)You continue but then suddenly feel the ground sloping downwards again. You’ve learned your lesson... **no more falling**.

You turn back to build your castle at Spot B.

You live a long life and die peacefully in the knowledge you had the best land in the kingdom.

👼 There’s an after-life
=======================

You wake up in the after-life, and an *omniscient being* forces you to review your choices:

1. You first found the global minimum (Spot A) and wisely avoided it.
2. Then, you encounter Spot B. You *exploit* this high land, committing to building your castle.
3. Shown the entire land, you realise you’ve only found a local maxima.

You stopped early before discovering the **global maximum**.

You’re furious to learn *King Chit*, your rival ruler who’s already read this newsletter seizes that land.

![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/pic4.jpeg)🎇 Explore-exploiting the best burger
====================================

In the search of true happiness, whether in finding the best work, becoming the best partner, or choosing the best life path, we hold limited resources with many potential sources of expenditure.

Down to the single-cellular level, we have found organisms using the *‘explore-exploit trade-off’* to guide decisions.

When I first moved to Hammersmith, I was in search of a new favourite restaurant (nothing can beat *Steaks on a Plane, Bolton*).

After my initial period of *exploring* options - Favourite's, Poppy’s II, Top’s Pizza - I found the *one*: ***Chicago Grill***. So I *“exploit”* - not in the negative sense, just that I kept going back.

By over-exploiting my first positive find, I risk sticking to a **local maximum** instead of the **global maximum** - the actual best restaurant in Hammersmith.

How can I avoid this?

🎲 Be random
===========

Computer scientists utilise **randomness**.

Even after finding my favourite restaurant, it’s important to *randomly* try another dish on the menu, or another place altogether - as long as the cost isn’t too great.

Computers also don’t fall for the *sunken cost fallacy* - once they find a better option, they change direction.

🕳 Global maxima don’t exist
===========================

In my story, an omniscient being tells you about the best choices you *could* have had.

In real life, we never know where the global maximum is (nor whether it exists). 

The goal isn’t to chase after this fairy-tale, becoming dissatisfied with everything.

Instead, we should fully live according to our values, being happy and grateful for the present, but we must be wary of the trap of assuming our way of living is the best way of living.

Have strong beliefs, loosely held.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* 📗 The Three Body Problem series by Liu Cixin *(book)* – this book combines the exciting fictional universe of genres like the Game of Thrones with the coolest, trippiest real-life science. It covers so many philosophy of science topics.
* [📗 The Bhagavad Gita translated by Eknath Easwaran *(book)* -](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12379467-the-bhagavad-gita) good modern English translation and explanation of the Bhagavad Gita.
* [🔊 Daily Breathing Techniques to transform your body and mind with James Nestor, on the Feel Better, Live More podcast -](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0oHyngcn7SUQoUaDSQnKht?si=df3f2837f54f4e88) our noses are “use it or lose it” organs. I struggled so much to breathe through my nose, and my asthma was worse. For the past year, I’ve been focussing on simple techniques to improve nasal breathing and subjectively, it’s made me feel a lot better - at rest, during exercise, and with my asthma. On this episode, they discuss all the science behind it.
* ✍ **Coding for medics Tutorial Weekend** - I’m doing a paid *Coding for Medics* weekend course to teach medics, who’ve never coded, to create their first programs with Python. Also advising on the higher-level skills of marketing your medic background, alongside coding knowledge, to network effectively and find exciting opportunities. DM me if you’re interested in either attending or helping!
