**Hello friends 💙**
===================


👩‍🔬 Mary’s Room
---------------


**Mary** lives in a grey room. She has always lived in a grey room. She has never seen any colour other than grey.


Mary is a brilliant **polymath neuroscientist** who’s *the* expert in **colour vision**. She’s absorbed all there is to know, and could ever be known, about the colour red.


She knows the exact wavelength of red and how it interacts with each particle. She knows the intricate structure of her eyes: how red wavelengths travel to the retina, their interaction with photo-receptor cells, and the precise pattern of neuronal processing that follows.


However, she has never seen the colour red herself.


Until one day, a grey door opens. She steps outside for the first time.


Mary sees a **red** apple.

---------------------------------


Does anything change upon Mary’s encounter with the apple?


Would you consider she has learned some new information through the act of experiencing the colour red herself?


If so, then you believe some knowledge escapes physical explanation. ‘*Physical*’ here refers to all sciences including Maths, Physics and Biology.


The philosopher, Professor Frank Jackson, argues **scientific explanation cannot capture all there is to know about reality**. To illustrate this, he proposed the *Mary’s Room* thought experiment within *‘Epiphenomenal Qualia’, The Philosophical Quarterly (1982)*.


☯ Qualia
--------


The term "**qualia**" refers to *what is it like* to experience something. Some argue Mary *has* learned new information: the **qualia** of seeing red.


When you listen to your favourite song or hug a loved one, you experience particular *qualia*. Your qualia are unique to you.


Your perception of the *redness* of red is possibly completely different to mine. I might see what you label as 'blue' but call it red.


Considering how physically different we all are, I think this is far more probable than us all experiencing colour the exact same way.


🌦 Qualia of mental health
-------------------------

There exists a common misconception about mental illness.


People believe mental illnesses are extremes of a ‘**normal**’ mood spectrum. If happiness and sadness existed on two ends of this spectrum, depression might be placed far beyond sadness.


However, I believe mental states should be thought of as **discrete, categorical variables**.


Depression is not merely an extreme of sadness — it’s an entirely different **qualia**. Sadness can precipitate depression, but depression exists separately.


I am greatly aggravated by those who mock mentally ill people. This includes those unfortunate enough to require in-patient Psychiatric treatment.


Those who mock the mentally ill have likely not yet experienced intense qualia of mental illness. I believe most people have had periods of mental affliction — but choose not to admit this to themselves or others. It’s still quite a stigma to tell people your mental health is a bit poorly.


👞 “Walk a mile in their shoes” is parochial
-------------------------------------------

I have small feet.


If I wear someone else’s shoes, they’ll probably be too big. I'd be uncomfortable and I wouldn’t like the style. I would spend the entire time thinking how much more I **dislike** that person for wearing shoes **so different** to mine.


This is because I’m simply imagining **myself** in **their** position. True **empathy** comes from attempting to understand *why* that person would choose to wear those awful shoes in the first place.


It is an endeavour to understand the *qualia* of their life: how prior circumstances led to present actions.


I definitely need more effort to do this. But the return on investment is increased compassion.


Truly disliking someone becomes increasingly difficult when considering the qualia of our fellow human beings' lives. I think simply basing my judgements on external perception is parochial.


Whenever I am annoyed by someone (*which happens **very** frequently thanks to Twitter*), I attempt to first understand *why* they are who they are; and whether I would act any differently if I experienced their life's qualia.


Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================


* **[Open Source is the Future of Medicine](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5O1FlLzjjkkDVM285vatoV?si=q83zaMR_Ro6YYz0VnZMzMg&dl_branch=1) (Podcast)** 🎙 - Dr Baw, an inspirational figure, speaks passionately about how we can actually fix the broken tech systems within the NHS. His solutions are open-source design and APIs. Really excited to hear more from him in the future. Also, you should absolutely check out the rest of the BigPictureMedicine episodes, hosted by my equally inspirational friend, Mustafa Sultan!
* **[Todoist](https://todoist.com/)** 📲 - for those of you who love #productivity, I've found a new task-management tool to replace Notion (which was way too slow on mobile and not convenient for quick-capturing tasks).
* **[Élite](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200942?source=35)** 🎥 - Netflix series that has zero substance, and yet is so addicting. Probably because there's so many peng Spanish people. New season just dropped!
