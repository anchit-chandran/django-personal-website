**Hello friends üíô**

**TikTok** is an abusive, technological marvel in so many ways.

Its User Interface (UI) removes the clock at the top of your screen, similar to casinos, so you don‚Äôt realise how long you‚Äôve spent. It prevents you from skipping to particular parts of the video/ going back if you miss something - thereby, forcing you to watch the entire thing again. 

But its crowning glory is its **algorithm**.

üì± *The* Algorithm
=================

Everyone knows how (scarily) good TikTok is at keeping you scrolling through endless videos. Its algorithm crunches through terabytes of data to keep you on the platform.

Its power is of no surprise when we consider the fact they're backed by the authoritarian and invasive Chinese government, who lack respect for any notion of ‚Äúindividual privacy‚Äù or ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù. If you‚Äôve ever downloaded the app, or even watched a TikTok online, your data already belongs to them.

Through this wealth of data, it infers even more user characteristics such as your ethnicity, religious beliefs, and sexual orientation. If you can find groups in this data, you can target content to boost watch time.

For example, *young, white, privileged, atheist Millennials, who visit Starbucks often,* may spend more time on the app (watching more ads) when shown puppy videos at 11 pm, whilst they‚Äôre in bed.

Profit is maximised by showing the right people the right content at the right time. 

But there‚Äôs too much data to be understood by humans.

üìä Classification Algorithms
===========================

TikTok identifies groups using **classification** machine learning algorithms.

The actual implementation is complex, but the core idea is understandable.

For example, when deciding which videos to show me, the algorithm considers variables like my `age` and my time spent watching videos tagged as `coding`. It compares this with similar users and places me in the Group `‚ÄòNerd‚Äô`. I get shown **maths videos interspersed with science videos** because Nerd Group users spend longer when shown this combination of content.

They just need to sort through all the data to find the right groups.

===================

An actual example that does this is called the **‚ÄòK-Means‚Äô** algorithm.

Let‚Äôs imagine we just use two variables to find different groups:

* `user_age` on the X-axis
* `time_spent_watching_coding_videos` on the Y-axis

We can already see 2 distinct groups: at the top-right and bottom-left:

![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/03/image-1.png)But the algorithm can‚Äôt see these groups: instead, it uses ‚ú®**maths**‚ú® to explicitly find groups in data.

üï∂ Some maths
------------

It needs *training* to identify the groups `Nerd` and `Not_Nerd`. Because we want to find **2 groups**, it randomly places 2 ‚Äò**centroids**‚Äô.

The computer calculates the distance between each point and centroid - assigning each point a particular Group, depending on its closest centroid. Through an iterative loop (shown in the gif below), the algorithm then finds the mean of each cluster and *moves the centroid* closer to the centre of each group. The process stops when the variance of each group is roughly the same.

=========================

This works fine for 2 variables. 

However, TikTok uses *millions* of variables per user. It‚Äôs hard to visualise identifying these groups because they exist in the *million*th dimension, but it‚Äôs very easy for algorithms to do so using maths.

![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/03/flea_col.gif)TikTok wastes this power on profit *(and probably pro-CCP propaganda)* but the possibilities are endless: you could predict general health status from Deliveroo data or suicidality from Tweeting habits.

You could do great good by targeting help.

Or you could selectively increase insurance prices and bar people from applying to your company.

What would you do?

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [**üìï Algorithms to Live By *(book)* ‚Äì**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions-ebook/dp/B015DLA0LE) re-reading this fantastic book - essentially how to live a happier, less stressful life by making better decisions, based on how computers have to do it. For example, how do you decide which house to buy? Or when to settle down?
