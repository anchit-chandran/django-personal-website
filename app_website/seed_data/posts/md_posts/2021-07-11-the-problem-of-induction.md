**Hello friends ðŸ’™**
===================


When I was 10, I burnt my finger on a hot iron.


It hurt a lot.


Until that point, I hadnâ€™t considered that hot irons could hurt. I learnt not to touch them because they cause pain.


I observed **A** (touching hot irons) always causes **B** (pain) in the past, so I assume **A** *will always* follow **B** in the future.


Why have I made this assumption?


My personal reason would be that I quite like my hand and donâ€™t want to damage it.


But itâ€™s also an example of a deeper unconscious belief we all share: **inductive reasoning**.


ðŸ’­ Inductive Reasoning
---------------------


We learn from prior experience by observing patterns and establishing explanations.


Presumably, this is a by-product of evolution: inductive reasoning allows animals to learn from the past and prepare for the future.


This strategy would greatly increase the chance of reproduction, propagating the â€˜inductive reasoningâ€™ genes.


But this presumption highlights a fallacy at the core of science: the **Problem of Induction**.


ðŸš« The Problem of Induction
--------------------------


How do I know that hot things will **always** hurt in the future?


One answer is that I have **always** observed this in the past. But this is a **Circular Argument**.


It isnâ€™t necessarily true that **because** we know why things happened previously, that Nature **will** remain the same hereafter.


One can observe only white swans their entire life. To conclude that *all swans are white* is false â€“ the presence of a single black swan would refute this entire premise, collapsing oneâ€™s worldview.


We canâ€™t simply assume that the future **will** resemble the past.


ðŸ”§ Utilising the Problem of Induction
------------------------------------


If we canâ€™t learn from the past, is it possible to know anything?


Thinking about it too deeply caused me a headache. Great thinkers have been considering this conundrum for years. Iâ€™m leaving the difficult thinking to them.


Instead of ruminating on the problem of induction itself, Iâ€™ve realised I can just use the belief in it as a powerful psychological tool.


â˜¯ Embracing Change
------------------


There will be tough times in our life.


There may be weeks, months, or even years when the odds are stacked against us.


We might lose our love of life.


The Problem of Induction suggests solace can be sought in the knowledge thereâ€™s every potential for change. The future resembling the past is merely an ***assumption***, not a guarantee.


The only way to truly know is to keep going.


Equally, we should remember that happiness derived from people or objects is fleeting. Loved ones should not be taken for granted because we can lose them at any point.


Focusing on the present allows us to appreciate what we already have.


Peace,
