**Hello friends ðŸ’™**
-------------------

Martial arts teaches you to **aim behind the target**.

When punching, your goal is to hit a point **behind** the object itself. This ensures you utilise full force and power during the punch. You donâ€™t slow your attack due to nearing the finish line.

In my new favourite book, â€˜*Can't Hurt Me*â€™, the author David Goggins describes the **40% rule**, which helped him achieve unbelievable feats of endurance.

ðŸ§  Matter over mind
==================

Our minds break long before our bodies.

When we reach the peripheries of our comfort zone, the demons in our heads start screaming. Theyâ€™ll lie that weâ€™ve come far enough, that we shouldnâ€™t keep going, that we should give up.

The truth is youâ€™re only **40% done**.

Pushing past 40% lets us bulldoze through the barriers of a weak mind. Itâ€™s what made Goggins **uncommon amongst the uncommon** â€“ separating himself from an already elite pack.

ðŸ¤¥ Stop listening to the lies
============================

Life throws many challenges: exams, careers, and relationships.

When the demons start gripping the mind, put those **cowards** on a tape recorder.

Hear the lies your mind tells you throughout the day; analyse how they hold you back, and then stop listening.

[You are not your thoughts](__GHOST_URL__/think-of-a-fruit/).

You have the ability to follow your own disciplined plans not just to the end, but beyond the finishing line.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [ðŸ”Š The Promises and Perils of AI *(podcast, The Tim Ferris Show)* â€“](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1AsRx4bGLRkLn6OWvGNQ5f?si=M6T50E4vQe2vxbeG-fpxkg) some dons talking about Web3, the future of crypto and NFTs.
* [ðŸ“• On Love by](https://www.academia.edu/7679168/Alain_de_Botton_Essays_in_love) *[Alain de Botton (book)](https://www.academia.edu/7679168/Alain_de_Botton_Essays_in_love)* [â€“](https://www.academia.edu/7679168/Alain_de_Botton_Essays_in_love) Alain is a British philosopher who captures the complexities of modern-day issues through the lens of philosophy. I particularly liked this essay â€“ he talks about the process of falling in and out of love, and the paradox of loving something imperfect. Reading it was genuinely like seeing my own mind.
