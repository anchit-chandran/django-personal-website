Hello friends 💙
===============

The inspiration for this initially came from a quote by Tristan Harris, director of [*The Social Dilemma*](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224?utm_campaign=Anchit&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter):


> *“Everyone’s living in their own Truman Show because of social media bubbles.”*

I’d recommend everyone to watch ‘*The Truman Show’*.

------------------------------------------------

Around March 2021, I spoke with a midwife who didn’t believe the COVID-19 vaccine was safe.

My instant gut reaction was: **this person must be crazy, dumb, and selfish**.

But instead of disengaging, I decided to explore her ideas and concerns. She sheepishly explained:

“I’ve read the studies and concluded there’s little data regarding the vaccine’s effects on foetuses and people with my medical conditions. I’m also a big supporter of vaccines in general.”

I hadn’t expected such a rational judgement. I would have never discovered it if we hadn’t continued speaking.

We had a fruitful discussion regarding how a lack of data doesn’t necessarily mean the vaccine is unsafe and about the **dangers of social media bubbles**.

**In-groups and Out-groups 👩🏿‍🤝‍👩🏾👩🏿‍🤝‍👩🏼**
-------------------------------------------

We live in a very divisive time.

The internet has allowed us to both connect and *disconnect*. Social media lets us easily find our tribe, full of like-minded friends. We learn and discuss topics we’re interested in from people who share our views.

Unfortunately, there’s a pernicious danger here: **forming in-groups means actively distancing from out-groups**.

**Echo Chambers 🔊**
-------------------

Our feeds end up presenting a false myopic reality.

On the surface, this doesn’t seem like a problem — why would we want to see content that causes us negative emotions? Well, I’d argue that curating our own **social media echo chambers** does us far more harm in the long run.

I used to only follow people with whom I fully agreed. Looking back, it seems like being in a **cult**:

* I liked only things my group liked
* I felt reactional rage towards those who against my group
* I made rash judgements about people I now respect like Ash Sarkar and Joe Rogan.

I developed a sense of **righteousness** from my identity. Everything I believed in was ***clearly correct*** because it made perfect rational sense.

This changed when I realised that I was a human, and humans aren’t perfect homogeneous creatures.

**Everyone thinks they’re right 🙄**
-----------------------------------

Through speaking to people, I’ve concluded that **everyone thinks they’re right**. We’d be pretty odd doing things that went against our beliefs and values.

I’d recommend the book ‘***The Righteous Mind*’** to better understand why people are so divided on topics like politics and religion. In short, people hold different *morality foundations*: some people care deeply about things like **autonomy**, whereas others care far more about **harm prevention** and **community**.

**Popping the social media bubble 💥**
-------------------------------------

My worldview isn’t perfect. I want to break through my **echo chamber**.

By following people whose views I actively disagree with, I’ve learned that most people **aren’t crazy**! The vast majority share my same core ideals of **life**, **liberty**, and the **pursuit of happiness**.

Unfortunately, different life experiences lead us to different conclusions.

Nonetheless, there’s a lot of common ground to be gained. I find these combined solutions are usually far greater than the individual opposing views.

Feel all of the elephant 🐘
--------------------------

Society is increasingly becoming **blind people feeling different parts of an elephant**.

In reality, everyone’s different experiences fit together to form a truer reality - one from which we can create positive change.

Learn why they’ve come to those conclusions and potentially update your own!

Cool things I've come across this week:
---------------------------------------

**📚 The Courage to Be Disliked —** The last time I read a book in one sitting, cover-to-cover, was when I was 15. Really fantastic book. Ignore the fortune cookie title.

**🎥 Bo Burnham - Inside** — Netflix musical that’s vaguely about the depressing capitalist machine to which we are all slaves.

**📚 How the World Thinks - A Global History of Philosophy** - recently finished this book about the history of Philosophy around the world. It’s given me a really interesting insight into other cultures - particularly the East Asian ones.

**🎥 Buddhism is Kinda Out There, Man** ([exurb1a](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCimiUgDLbi6P17BdaCZpVbg?utm_campaign=Anchit&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) - YouTube video that’s just good vibes.
