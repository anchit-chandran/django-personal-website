**Hello friends 💙**
===================


Life is **stressful**.

Stress is **sometimes** good: it can motivate us to achieve our goals. However, stress can become so overwhelming that it impacts both productivity and mental health.


Tools for managing stress are important because we only possess a finite capacity for it. Like a glass of water, it’s good to have some but too much and the contents spill out, potentially ruining our day.


Learning about a psychological tool, **The Trichotomy of Control**, was a game-changer for me.


🔱 Trichotomy of Control
=======================


Most life events can be simplified to the degree of control we hold over them:


1. **No Control** — events fully out of our control, such as whether there will be a global pandemic.
2. **Some Control** — events for which we have *some* degree of control, such as doing well in an exam.
3. **Full Control** — events completely in our control, such as actually revising for an exam.


🔴No Control
===========


There are events for which I can exert no influence on the outcome.


In these instances, anxiety serves no benefit and only causes me **psychological harm**.


It is an unnecessary expenditure of my **limited stress budget** that leaves less space for more worthwhile things.


This doesn’t make it particularly easy to *actually* stop worrying — but I find it a useful first step towards tranquillity.


🟠Some Control
=============


The majority of my budget is devoted to events for which I have **Some Control**.


I’ve recently finished my fifth-year medical school exams. I worked hard to ensure I wouldn’t regret my performance.


Even still, I can’t guarantee success — there’s every possibility I got unlucky on the day.


However, I focused my stress on ensuring I had the highest *probability* of doing well by revising appropriately.


At the very least, I hold no regrets about the period before my exams, and I am happy to **accept** the consequences thereafter (in reality, I’m still quite anxious, but at least I have a tool to calm me if the nerves get too much).


🟢Complete Control
=================


The remaining capacity is spent on **Complete Control** events.


I **do** have complete control over aspects internal to myself such as my goals and values.


**I** have decided to be a **good doctor** — this decision was **completely** in my control. This helps me remain disciplined about studying, especially when I lack motivation, as I want to fulfil my future goals.


My internal responses to the external world are, arguably, the *only* things I truly control.

🤪#YOLO
======


On days my anxiety gets the better of me, stratifying my worries according to their degree of control helps alleviate some stress. I usually realise many items **don’t warrant my energy**.


Moreover, knowing that the events I’m worrying about *are worth worrying about* oddly takes some stress away.


It’s like no longer needing to **run for survival**; I can just run ~~for pleasure~~ because it’s healthy.


Life is only short if the majority of it is spent **worrying** about the past, **neglecting** the present, and **fearing** the future.


We only get to live our lives once. Why not focus on minimising negative emotions and maximising positive ones?


Peace,
