**Hello friends 💙**
===================

Medical school exam results used to **sadden** me.

At Imperial, I realised I’m not that intelligent. I just used to work **much** harder at school.

Coming out of sixth-form, my identity was attached to being academically gifted. It **surprised** me I didn’t get results without putting in the work.

The people who perform consistently well at medschool deserve it. Their results are a product of their hard work and determination.

I would get upset, envious and even jealous of my peers’ success. Not that I did especially bad, but not *as well* as I believed I should.

👨‍🎓 I don't want to be the best doctor
======================================

In the past, my life was geared towards gaining success in the medical field. I assumed **academic prowess** was the only way to get there.

Medical school performance is an important factor in becoming the best doctor.

I thought I wanted to become the best doctor.

But over the past few years, I’ve discovered that isn't the game I want to play.

🕹 Life's a Game
===============

Every action made in the *pursuit of happiness* is part of your own, individual **Game**.

Realising that **I’m not playing the same Game** as everyone else hugely calmed my anxieties.

We’re all unique individuals with different **Qualities**.

For example, some of my Qualities include *Medicine*, *coding*, and *mindfulness*.

Improving a Quality requires a combination of **natural talent** and **grit**. Talent is a fixed variable but you *can* work harder to improve pretty much anything.

The sum of all your Qualities estimates life happiness: being good at everything you do increases your chances of fulfilment.

🧪 The Relevance Factor
======================

There's a crucial element missing: the **Relevance Factor** attached to each Quality.

Let’s assume my Medicine Quality is a decent **6/10**. I *could* improve my performance by working a lot harder – but this wouldn’t make me happy.

I love Medicine but its Relevance Factor is relatively low for me. I refuse to work a 9-5 job for the rest of my life, and I'd be working even longer in the NHS.

My Medicine Relevance Factor is only **5/10**.

This doesn’t mean I can sack off being a serious candidate – **being a *bad* doctor is** **antithetical to my life goals**. There’s a **range of ability** I must be in, but working harder beyond this is wasted effort without extra happiness.

🎮 Finding my Game
=================

My Game isn't to be the best doctor. It's more about being a **good** doctor, who codes, and advocates positive mental health.

Internalising this frees up energy to focus on my other Qualities for which the Relevance Factor is much higher.

I provide more benefit to myself and society with my *synergistic combination* of qualities as a whole. 

Knowing my Game optimised my **happiness**.

🔎 What matters to you?
======================

Identifying Qualities and abilities is simple.

However, deciding *Relevance Factors* requires **introspective scrutiny**.

You must decide not just what you want **in** life (e.g. a good job, wealth, success) but what you want **out** of life – to reach the finish line knowing you’ve lived with **purpose**.

Regardless of what happens, I’m confident I’m making the **best decisions** for myself.

A bad outcome from the right choice doesn’t make the choice itself any less correct. Especially if it aligns with my Game.

**Shit happens** that we can’t control but living according to our values generates the strength and courage to deal with anything. 

Your values are the rules to your Game. You need to decide your Game before you can make the rules.

Then you can start playing.

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [📕 Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke *(book)*](https://g.co/kgs/uRyqB7) – I thought this was a nicher book I read during first Lockdown, that I admittedly didn’t find interesting all the way through. However, the core ideas are very compelling and have been referenced by so many people. Would recommend skim-reading it or looking at a summary!
* [🎶 Hyphen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Ktr0i8RmKTMlBFuqhMkAi?si=zNP00oMFT22zKEhTfepHIg&dl_branch=1) *[(musician)](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Ktr0i8RmKTMlBFuqhMkAi?si=zNP00oMFT22zKEhTfepHIg&dl_branch=1)* – current favourite artist. My guy is a Brown King, used to be an investment banker but decided to pursue music, tunes are very good vibes and about self-love and positive mental health.
