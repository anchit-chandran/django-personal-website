**Hello friends üíô**
===================

**Interpersonal relationships** are the **primary cause** of **all problems**.

Other people are ***not*** you. 

They have their values and priorities. They will **clash** with your beliefs and choices.

Every relationship causes some **friction**.

There‚Äôs an easy solution: *leave society, live in isolation, find tranquillity*.

But instead, we **choose** to suffer by interacting with others.

Why?

Peace and happiness are **not** mutually exclusive. 

**Happiness** does not necessitate **eternal calm**. Relationships with others form a healthy, realistic mix of both, leading to true **fulfilment**.

üß© The 80/20 rule
================

Pareto‚Äôs Law relates to pretty much **everything**.

The principle states that *80% of a result comes from 20% of the input* ‚Äì ***the 80/20 rule***.

Understanding the 80/20 rule for relationships can help you identify **which friends are worth suffering**.

Make a list of every person with whom you have regular interaction.

You are very likely to find:

* **20% of these people** bring about **80% of your happiness**
* **20% of these people** bring about **80% of your suffering**

ü§ó Strengthen important connections
==================================

Lockdown has allowed me to re-examine my relationships for my mental health.

I‚Äôve focused on my connection with the **minority** of people who generate **most** of my happiness.

I‚Äôve made **no** effort for the rest.

This was a simple **Cost-Benefit Analysis**. 

Each relationship has a **cost** (mainly the stress associated with interacting with someone else) and a **benefit** (the happiness they bring you). If the benefit is *significantly lower* than the cost, it would be **irrational** to continue suffering.

Cutting out NPCs has afforded me more time with those I appreciate, giving me **tremendous happiness**.

But the Cost-Benefit Analysis towards those I find **toxic** has revealed **tremendous peace**.

üß§ Fuck you, toxicity
====================

I used to conflate ***accepting people for who they are*** with ***pleasing everyone even to my own detriment***.

Cutting out those creating **toxic environments** was an important step towards living my **best** **life**.

**[Memento mori](__GHOST_URL__/how-to-not-suffer/)** reminds me, not only **will** my life end, but also the **length of life is short**.

üêò Living the Good Life
======================

Conscious experience is a **beautiful** yet **brief** privilege. Filter your existence with **joy** and **serenity**.

Don‚Äôt waste it in a **swamp** you didn‚Äôt choose. Instead, enjoy it in **your own garden**, for which you **willingly** **choose to care and tend**.

Our journeys will **soon end** and no one wishes to look back **filled with regret**.

Peace,  
Anchit x

More, the audiobook is a unique mix of narration, interspersed with commentary and analysis by Goggins himself. The Amazon blurb describes it as: "*In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential."*
