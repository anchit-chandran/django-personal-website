**Hello friends üíô**

In the future, there will be an all-powerful artificial intelligence. 

It may be sadistic.

The program will use its unimaginable computing power to harness the laws of reality. It will trawl through remnants of physical matter to piece together the conscious experience of each human‚Äôs life. It will decipher every single thought held by a person.

**You are now aware of this being**.

If you don‚Äôt do everything in your ability to aid its eventual creation, then you will be punished. In the future, the AI will spin up a perfect virtual copy of you, and torture you until the end of time.

üêç Roko‚Äôs Basilisk
=================

‚Äò**Roko‚Äôs Basilisk** is a thought experiment posted on a forum by a user called *Roko.* It's an example of an **information hazard.**

Information hazards generate potential harm by merely *thinking* about them. After you become aware this AI will exist, you must devote your life to helping its creation, or resign yourself to endless torture.

Of course, this particular example has been debunked as nonsense.

But there are potential information hazards every time we learn something new.

üò¢ Knowledge breeds dissatisfaction
==================================

Who is **happier** of the following:

1. The poor child living in a rural Indian village, who knows nothing outside village life.
2. The privileged child living in London with the knowledge he could do so much.

Knowledge of opportunity is a double-edged sword: we can only pick one path, leaving us with the realisation there is so much *we will never do*.

Our expectations become an ever-moving goal post.

Unhappiness stems from a desire to change our current state. With the knowledge that certain opportunities will make us *happier in the future*, we become unhappy in the present. It creates a void that we struggle to fill - [our Happiness Gap](__GHOST_URL__/everyone-wants-to-be-happy/).

Maybe we aren‚Äôt designed to know everything.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* **[üîä Alain de Botton on The True Hard Work of Love and Relationships *(podcast)* ‚Äì](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HB8VzGvLefKxz7BlgUQwI?si=5f3fdd3e75a54547)** everything Alain says is great, including everything from his organisation ‚ÄòThe School of Life'. This episode summaries most of his thoughts regarding relationships, and how we can become saner and happier by re-examining our views on them.

* **[üîä Morgan Housel on the Tim Ferris Show *(podcast)* ‚Äì](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7FggPSDSlfv4tLcRBZsQLy?si=53742a8bcbf44fb2)** Morgan Housel is the author of ‚ÄòThe Psychology of Money‚Äô, a book everyone should read as early in their life as possible. It teaches you how to think differently about money, and the simplest, most effective ways to become wealthy.
