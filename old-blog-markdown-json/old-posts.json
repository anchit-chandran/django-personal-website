This added nuance is harder to attack.\n\nFor example, I could assert:\n\n> We should engage people with opposing views\nDepending on the social environment, I might also decide to hedge the statement:\n\n> We should engage people with opposing views BUT I don’t support engaging those\nwho preach hatred or harm, like racists, sexists and homophobes.\nMy hedge clarifies exactly which kind of people we should engage, in case anyone\ntakes issue with my original assertion.\n\nWhy 'hedge'? ✅\nI see two reasonable motivations to hedge:\n\n 1. To avoid being a dick: we should hedge when saying things that could be\n    reasonably misconstrued. This prevents unnecessarily hurt feelings, harm, or\n    loss of social capital.\n 2. To form stronger arguments: when debating, we need to win. Utilising hedges \n    fortifies arguments, preventing opponents from attacking irrelevant points.\n\nIn all other instances, I despise hedging.\n\nWhy not ‘hedge’? ❌\nGreat people have historically never hedged their revolutionary ideas.\n\nPlus, life is far more fun not hedging.\n\nWe clarify because we second-guess negative reception. When we constantly\nconsider what others may think, we create our own anxiety.\n\nWe stop truly believing our own world views.\n\nNothing matters so have fun 🏄‍♀️\nOn the cosmic scale, nothing we do matters.\n\nThe eventual heat death of our galaxy doesn’t care we said something silly that\none time. Deep down, humans already know this. We place meaning in things we\ndecide matter such as getting a good job or being successful.\n\nIt makes life worth living.\n\nDeveloping the courage to speak without hedges allows us to live a more\nmeaningful life because at the very least: this chosen belief is ours, not\nsomeone else’s.\n\nWhy I don’t ‘hedge’ 💢\nNeeding to hedge everything in controversial topics seems tedious to me. There\nare two reasons for this.\n\nFirstly, my worldview is almost definitely wrong.\n\nIf I start hedging, I place myself into a debating mindset. Debating\nnecessitates a winner and loser. This is in stark contrast to a friendly\ndiscussion that seeks to simply find the truth. When we need to be right, we\nhold onto beliefs too strongly, even in the presence of valid contradictory\nevidence.\n\nThis propagates societal cracks.\n\nSecondly, I refuse to waste effort appeasing people who would automatically\nassume the worst.\n\nLife is too short to allow them to live in my head rent-free. I can spend more\ntime listening to people whose values I respect, which is crucial as I am never\nright.\n\nThey understand the scope of my beliefs does not extend towards harm, so I am\neager to learn from them on how to improve my views.\n\nSocietal hedging 🤼‍♀️\nI’ve noticed girls hedge more than boys.\n\nI’m pretty sure this is because guys overestimate and girls vastly underestimate\nthemselves. Girls also tend to be a lot more empathetic — considering their\nwords from many different viewpoints.\n\nThough this is admirable, I fear hedging can water down great ideas – leading to\nthem being unintentionally misinterpreted. \n\nHowever, I can't relate to women's lived experiences and I'm blind to numerous\nbarriers others face. There may be many more reasons as to why someone might\nhedge. I’m very unsure about this and would love to hear your thoughts (hit\nreply or DM me)!\n\nStatements can get hedged so much that we end up saying nothing. Life is a lot\nmore exciting when leaving ideas open and inviting discussion.\n\nPeace,\n\nAnchit x\n\nCool things I've come across this week:\n * I now have a website I'm really excited about and you should definitely check\n   out: anchit.me [__GHOST_URL__/] \n * 📱 @jack.lowro [https://www.tiktok.com/@jack.lawro?] (TikTok) - a don who\n   clearly conveys philosophy of science concepts.\n * 📹 Psychiatrist reacts to: \"I have too much self-awareness\"\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So7hE1Ba_QA] - YouTube video where a\n   Psychiatrists talks about the link between our Default Mode Network,\n   depression & anxiety, and a potential explanation of the therapeutic effects\n   of dissociatives & psychedelics.

If happiness and sadness existed on two ends of this spectrum, depression might be placed far beyond sadness. \\n\\nHowever, I believe mental states should be thought of as **discrete, categorical variables**. \\n\\nDepression is not merely an extreme of sadness — it’s an entirely different **qualia**. Sadness can precipitate depression, but depression exists separately.\\n\\nI am greatly aggravated by those who mock mentally ill people. This includes those unfortunate enough to require in-patient Psychiatric treatment.\\n\\nThose who mock the mentally ill have likely not yet experienced intense qualia of mental illness. I believe most people have had periods of mental affliction — but choose not to admit this to themselves or others. It’s still quite a stigma to tell people your mental health is a bit poorly.\\n\\n## 👞 “Walk a mile in their shoes” is parochial \\n\\n> *Before you judge someone, walk a mile in their shoes.*\\n\\nI have small feet. \\n\\nIf I wear someone else’s shoes, they’ll probably be too big. I'd be uncomfortable and I wouldn’t like the style. I would spend the entire time thinking how much more I **dislike** that person for wearing shoes **so different** to mine.\\n\\nThis is because I’m simply imagining **myself** in **their** position.  True **empathy** comes from attempting to understand *why* that person would choose to wear those awful shoes in the first place. \\n\\nIt is an endeavour to understand the *qualia* of their life: how prior circumstances led to present actions.\\n\\nI definitely need more effort to do this. But the return on investment is increased compassion.\\n\\nTruly disliking someone becomes increasingly difficult when considering the qualia of our fellow human beings' lives. I think simply basing my judgements on external perception is parochial.\\n\\nWhenever I am annoyed by someone (*which happens **very** frequently thanks to Twitter*), I attempt to first understand *why* they are who they are; and whether I would act any differently if I experienced their life's qualia.\\n\\nPeace,\\nAnchit x\\n\\n---\\n# Cool things I've come across this week:\\n   * **[Open Source is the Future of Medicine](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5O1FlLzjjkkDVM285vatoV?si=q83zaMR_Ro6YYz0VnZMzMg&dl_branch=1) (Podcast)** 🎙 - Dr Baw, an inspirational figure, speaks passionately about how we can actually fix the broken tech systems within the NHS.

She has always lived in a grey room. She has never\nseen any colour other than grey.\n\nMary is a brilliant polymath neuroscientist who’s the expert in colour vision.\nShe’s absorbed all there is to know, and could ever be known, about the colour \nred.\n\nShe knows the exact wavelength of red and how it interacts with each particle.\nShe knows the intricate structure of her eyes: how red wavelengths travel to the\nretina, their interaction with photo-receptor cells, and the precise pattern of\nneuronal processing that follows.\n\nHowever, she has never seen the colour red herself.\n\nUntil one day, a grey door opens. She steps outside for the first time.\n\nMary sees a red apple.\n\nMary sees red. Image from The New Atlantis\n[https://www.thenewatlantis.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/20170319_TNA51Schulman1200x627.jpg]\n🍎 Has Mary learned something new?\nDoes anything change upon Mary’s encounter with the apple?\n\nWould you consider she has learned some new information through the act of\nexperiencing the colour red herself?\n\nIf so, then you believe some knowledge escapes physical explanation. ‘Physical’\nhere refers to all sciences including Maths, Physics and Biology.\n\nThe philosopher, Professor Frank Jackson, argues scientific explanation cannot\ncapture all there is to know about reality. To illustrate this, he proposed the \nMary’s Room thought experiment within ‘Epiphenomenal Qualia’, The Philosophical\nQuarterly (1982).\n\n☯ Qualia\nThe term \"qualia\" refers to what is it like to experience something. Some argue\nMary has learned new information: the qualia of seeing red.\n\nWhen you listen to your favourite song or hug a loved one, you experience\nparticular qualia. Your qualia are unique to you.\n\nYour perception of the redness of red is possibly completely different to mine.\nI might see what you label as 'blue' but call it red.\n\nConsidering how physically different we all are, I think this is far more\nprobable than us all experiencing colour the exact same way.\n\n🌦 Qualia of mental health\n> “In depression, the meaninglessness of every enterprise and every emotion, the\nmeaninglessness of life itself, becomes self-evident.”\n- Andrew Solomon, The Noonday Demon\n\n\nThere exists a common misconception about mental illness.\n\nPeople believe mental illnesses are extremes of a ‘normal’ mood spectrum. If\nhappiness and sadness existed on two ends of this spectrum, depression might be\nplaced far beyond sadness.\n\nHowever, I believe mental states should be thought of as discrete, categorical\nvariables.\n\nDepression is not merely an extreme of sadness — it’s an entirely different \nqualia. Sadness can precipitate depression, but depression exists separately.\n\nI am greatly aggravated by those who mock mentally ill people. This includes\nthose unfortunate enough to require in-patient Psychiatric treatment.\n\nThose who mock the mentally ill have likely not yet experienced intense qualia\nof mental illness. I believe most people have had periods of mental affliction —\nbut choose not to admit this to themselves or others. It’s still quite a stigma\nto tell people your mental health is a bit poorly.\n\n👞 “Walk a mile in their shoes” is parochial\n> Before you judge someone, walk a mile in their shoes.\n\n\nI have small feet.\n\nIf I wear someone else’s shoes, they’ll probably be too big.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the\nhonest fact that I don’t care much about many topics.\n\nI can’t care about everything.\n\n🦥 Complacency is dangerous\nWith this being said, the real danger lies in becoming complacent that we can’t \ncare about everything.\n\nFor those who wish to leave the world better than they found it, more is\nrequired.\n\nObviously, I care about children dying in other countries.\n\nHowever, with all the other things I care about, where I can make an actionable\nchange, I may lump it into the “would care but can’t care” category and continue\nwith my life.\n\nThis isn’t good enough.\n\nBy avoiding discomfort, I also lack the motivation to improve and educate\nmyself.\n\nWe become satisfied that simply holding values such as “no one should starve” is\nadequate.\n\nWhen we’re not aware we’re doing anything wrong, we have no desire to put it\nright.\n\nWe need to catch ourselves slackin’ before we can reform (a core tenet of CBT!).\n\n✨ Step 1: admitting it\nA better mindset is to admit to ourselves that we do not care about a lot of\nthings.\n\nThe ability to make a list of matters we don’t currently care enough about is\nbeneficial: our blind spot (those things we don’t know we don’t know) is reduced\nand targets for self-improvement are identified.\n\n🗣 Speak your audience’s language\nIt’s equally important for stakeholders to provide a compelling reason as to why\npeople should care.\n\nThis is a case-by-case proposition. Matters like systemic racism become arduous\nto argue if you’re having to validate your existence.\n\nWhen learning about a problem I care about deeply, I attempt to find ways to\nrelate this problem to others. I try to convey the importance of why they should\ncare as I’m aware there was a point in my life where I also did not care.\n\nCommunicating in the language of our audience is crucial.\n\nFor example, simply telling billionaires that “climate change = bad” is\nineffective. It would be great to live in a world where selfishness didn’t\noverrule compassion, but this is our reality.\n\nInstead, we can present the strong, multi-faceted business case for\nsustainability. Translated viewpoints are the best way to enact change.\n\nIt all starts by realising: we don’t care.\n\nPeace,\nAnchit x\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCool things I've come across this week:\n * 🦠 My positive Corona test\n * 📜 This article [https://t.co/1qR8oKEs7k] - found it in an enthralling \n   Twitter thread hole\n   [https://twitter.com/heyibrah/status/1418220496450031617?s=21].

For months\nafterwards, I was happy.\n\nBut again, my happiness waned.\n\nI was living the dream of 16-year-old Anchit and yet, at the beginning of my\nsecond year, I took it for granted.\n\nSomething else was still missing; I realised I had a new goal: becoming a doctor\n.\n\nThen, my life would be okay.\n\n👨‍⚕️ Becoming a doctor\nFive years later, I’m almost there.\n\nHowever, I fear the same pattern will repeat.\n\nOnce I graduate from medical school, I will be ecstatic.\n\nBut despite how fulfilling medicine is, I’ll eventually get used to it.\n\nLike my computer and medical school, my happiness will wane.\n\nI’ll need something else to fill the void because only then life would be okay.\n\n🕳 The Happiness Gap\nThe difference between my happiness now and the happiness I want is my Happiness\nGap.\n\nThere are two ways to eradicate the Gap:\n\n1. Living for the future\nI can keep trying to improve my current situation and hope that life would be\nokay once I achieve all my dreams.\n\nThough possible, my experience so far suggests it's unlikely.\n\nRegardless of whether it might work later, it still means suffering now. \n\nThat sounds depressing and I don’t like depression.\n\n2. Living for the present\nAlternatively, I could try being happier with the current circumstance.\n\nThis is easier said than done but luckily better people than myself have\ndeveloped ways to be happy right now (aside from MDMA).\n\nOne technique I’ve enjoyed is negative visualisation: thinking about losing\npossessions (e.g. my phone, my wealth, my loved ones), to encourage gratitude\nfor their existence.\n\nI’ve found it powerful in reclaiming joy.\n\n🚱 Being someone else\nOne example of negative visualisation is imagining you lived the life of someone \nless fortunate: without food, water, or shelter.\n\nBy reframing our reference for happiness, we become grateful for these basic\namenities. It creates delight in the mundane.\n\nMy life, even with all my woes, is already someone else’s dream life.\n\nThis may sound similar to: “be grateful, there are starving kids in India”.\n\nBy itself, that notion doesn't truly resonate with me because I don’t find\nmeaning in simply surviving. Though it’s still important to develop gratitude\ntowards the basics, I need more to live a happy and fulfilling life.\n\n💙 Love\nWe privileged few worry a lot about finding the perfect partner. \n\nMany important features are considered like status, career, and appearance.\n\nImagine trying to find the perfect partner but also not having access to safe\ndrinking water. One may need to travel miles carrying heavy gallons of barely\ndrinkable water.\n\nIn this instance, we don’t have the luxury to seriously consider a potential\npartner’s superficial qualities. Instead, we must first consider their size from\na survival aspect: a larger person requires more water, which is more difficult.\n\nThe freedom to choose our partners according to the most minute details, which\ndon’t really matter, makes them far more special. \n\nWe chose them, rather than external circumstances dictating who we have to date.\n\nRecognising the freedoms afforded to me even in the intangible helped me start\nbecoming happier.\n\n☯ Choosing to be happy\nThere are times I’ve hated medical school.\n\nWe get boring placements in ugly hospitals with nasty teams. Even the commute\nbecomes depressing.\n\nThis year, I’ve attempted to make an effort in seeing the positives. I chose to\nstudy medicine so I have to be present, even if it’s a bit meh.\n\nIf I’ve chosen to do something, it’s wasteful to lament when I could choose joy \ninstead. It’s essential to find positives because what's the alternative?\n\nSuffering.\n\nThis mindset also gives me the strength to actively minimise negatives (like\nbecoming confident about leaving useless clinics and speaking out against\nconsultant bullying).\n\nNegative visualisation reminded me how lucky I am to attend even the worst\nplacements because I was still learning to save lives at one of the best medical\nschools in the world.\n\nI owe it to little Anchit to choose to be happy.\n\nPeace,\nAnchit x\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCool things I've come across this week:\n * 💙 My NEGATIVE Rona test 😎\n * 🎥 Fight Club [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/] (film) - one of my\n   favourite films but when rewatching it this week, I started appreciating the\n   deep Nietzschean philosophy.

I appreciate her nudging\nreminders to let my barriers down.\n\nShe’s the only person I would recommend everyone meets at least once.\n\nAnd as much as I can tell you how she made me feel, you will only understand by\nmeeting her yourself (big up Mary’s Room\n[https://www.anchit.me/4-considering-the-qualia-of-human-life/]).\n\nPeace,\nAnchit x\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCool things I've come across this week:\n * 🎶 Molly (Lil Dicky ft.

It’s the best\nway to support me 😃\n\nHello friends 💙\nWhy do we suffer?\n\nLast week, I was unfortunate enough to get a Tesco shopping trolley whose front\nwheel was broken.\n\nI struggled to push it around, trying to force it the way I wanted. I was \ndissatisfied with the fact I picked this awful trolley. \n\nThe entire shopping trip, I suffered.\n\nAcceptance of Fate\nThe Eastern philosophies, particularly Hinduism and Buddhism, shed light on one\ncause of suffering: Duhkha.\n\nDuhkha refers to the suffering caused by a refusal to accept the Wheels of Fate.\n\nNature does as Nature decides. \n\nWe have very little control over external events. Trying to resist the natural\nflow is a wasted effort, and leads to suffering.\n\nMany philosophies exist to overcome Duhkha and reach enlightenment; in this\ncase, it means wholly accepting life for what it is.\n\nAs ever, people hold different views on how to conquer Duhkha. \n\nI prefer another solution: Amor Fati.\n\nLove of Fate\nThough I vibe Eastern philosophies, my greatest gripe is with this simple \nacceptance of fate.\n\nI won’t be a punching bag for whichever entity spins the Wheels of Fate, as they\nseem non-benevolent.\n\nInstead, I like to consider all events, both enjoyments and obstacles, as fuel\nfor the flame which powers my life’s purpose.\n\nIn this way, one can appreciate even the bad times; to develop Amor Fati – a \nlove of fate.\n\nGood times can only be good with reference to bad times. One can be grateful for \nboth as neither could exist without the other.\n\nThe ups and downs of life are crucial in forming the shape of the journey we\ntravel.\n\nUntil we die.\n\nRemembering death\nYou could die by the end of this article.\n\nKnowing your flame will soon be extinguished, how much more would you appreciate \nlife? Does a reminder of your mortality lead to a newfound savouring of the \npleasure of existence?\n\nWhen I really don’t want to leave the comfort of my bed, I consider Memento Mori \n– a reminder that I too shall die. \n\nThe boring ward round I have to do becomes the last boring ward round I get to\ndo.\n\nWhen I forget Memento Mori, I become absorbed by Duhkha.\n\nI forget this is all temporary.\n\nI forget that on my death bed, I could look back on my years filled with regret.\n\nI forget to live rather than just exist.\n\nAs a wise woman once said:\n\n> “Feel the rain on your skin, no one else can feel it for you”\n- Natasha Bedingfield\nOnly you have been blessed with the sacred opportunity to experience your life.\n\nAs we must be us, we may as well enjoy it by defeating suffering, through a love\nof fate, and remembering our mortality.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCool things I've come across this week:\n * 🔊 Russell Brand speaking to Ben Shapiro\n   [https://open.spotify.com/episode/24pVqci0zG07SpVpEPfyIz?si=b20ShpHKTuqcT2TiMFYhyA&dl_branch=1] \n   – Shapiro is a dumb dumb but I really rate Russell and I think he sets a\n   really good example of how to productively disagree with people who have\n   completely opposing world views but also share some fundamental ideals.\n * 📽 Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay [app://obsidian.md/index.html] –\n   ??? good film tho","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507617458722-9591b6b54cae?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEzfHxoaW5kdWlzbXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2Mjk4MzE3NTc&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-08-24T19:01:55.000Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T19:11:28.000Z","published_at":"2021-08-24T19:11:28.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6271011e6924a00031072614","lexical":null},{"id":"612cdaac1f9928003b8e4328","uuid":"c69c3d2d-b566-4d15-96d0-8b9d242a85d8","title":"Nothing matters","slug":"nothingmatters","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.ted.com/talks/hannah_fry_the_mathematics_of_love?language=en\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/70143842?source=35\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.instagram.com/realdepressionproject/?hl=en\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"h1\",[[0,[0],1,\"Hello friends 💙\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I like my daily iced Mochas from Pret.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[1,0],2,\"Why?\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Well, I bought the \"],[0,[0],1,\"subscription.\"],[0,[],0,\" I like that it’s a \"],[0,[0],1,\"cooling drink\"],[0,[],0,\".

I like that it’s a cooling drink. Most\nimportantly, I need caffeine.\n\nWhy?\n\nCaffeine lets me be productive.\n\nSo?\n\nProductivity allows me to achieve the goals and values I’ve set myself.\n\nWhy do they matter?\n\nThey let me be a good person for myself and others.\n\nWhy be good?\n\nBeing good is the best way to live.\n\nWhy?\n\nThere’s no objective reason.\n\n🖤 Nihilism\nFor everything we believe important, with depressingly few numbers of “why?”s,\nthis same conclusion is always reached.\n\nWe are homogeneous concentrations of energy, perched on the surface of a mundane \nrock, hurtling through the endless void of space.\n\nAs monkeys with opposable thumbs, we have conquered land, sea and air. Space is\nour next frontier.\n\nAnd yet, the human race exists unaware of the insignificance of our mortality.\nWe stand on the precipice of multiple extinction-level events. \n\nNone of this matters.\n\n‘Good’ and ‘bad’ do not fundamentally exist.\n\n😥 Nothing matters\nTo clarify, this includes both the best things and the worst things. In the\ngrand scheme of our uncaring universe, nothing objectively matters.\n\nMy desires? Meaningless.\n\nMy values? Meaningless.\n\nMy pain? Especially meaningless.\n\nAll I know for certain is that I don’t matter.\n\nAttempting to fight this fundamental truth is a Sisyphean undertaking.\n\n😁 Nothing matters!\nThough I sometimes ascribe to pessimism, I don’t wish this for others.\n\nConsider the optimistic view of Nihilism: it’s a freeing belief.\n\nIt is because nothing matters that you can live your best life, with “best”\ndecided upon by yourself.\n\n💃 Life is a dance\nThe fight against barren purposelessness creates fun.\n\nWhether we win or lose, the only important thing is deciding to continue \nfighting.\n\nLife is a dance.\n\nWe don’t dance to reach the other side.\n\nWe dance for the sake of dancing; for the beauty and joy it evokes; to enjoy it\nwhilst doing it.\n\nDon’t stop dancing.\n\nPeace,\nAnchit x\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy this article?

They cut corners to optimise production, at the\ncost of your brain health, to increase their bottom line. They are the reason\nmulti-vitamins are largely useless.\n\nWhy do you need supplements for your brain?\n\nSure, not everyone does. You could already be getting all the vitamins you need\n(according to research for long-term brain health and preventing cognitive\ndecline) from your diet which includes:\n\n 1.  Green, leafy vegetables 5x a week\n 2.  5+ different coloured fruits and vegetables every day.\n 3.  Berries 5x a week.\n 4.  5+ servings of nuts a week\n 5.  Olive oil 5x a week\n 6.  Whole grains 5x a week\n 7.  Oily fish 2x a week or take an algae-based omega 3 supplement\n 8.  Legumes and pulses 5x a week\n 9.  White meat/mix of plant-based proteins 2x a week\n 10. Vitamin D supplement\n 11. Minimal processed foods\n 12. No more than 1 glass of wine a day\n 13. 1-2x coffee or tea a day max\n 14. 2L water a day\n\nThis would be impossible for me to keep consistent – and if we're not\nconsistent, there’s no point.\n\nThankfully, Heights have solved the issue by condensing all the benefits above\ninto their capsules. They have made the habit formation aspect frictionless\nwhich is crucial because consistency is the number one thing that will make\nimprove your brain health.\n\nAnd you need a healthy brain to do more and live a happy life.\n\n🦸‍♂️ Dan Murray-Serter\nI’ve listened to this podcast, The Secret Leaders\n[https://open.spotify.com/show/2IwIk50zNhVsgK0rQRSik7?si=5d225493644d4615], for\na long time. \n\nI always thought the host, Dan Murray-Serter, had a unique way of connecting\nwith others and humanising business.\n\nOne day, he spoke about mental health explicitly – both his own journey and the\nexperiences of other CEOs.\n\nIn the past, mental health was taboo. I felt lonely and terrified I couldn’t be\nsuccessful if I suffered from any problems.\n\nListening to my dude talk so freely about mental health with these people\nearning millions and running companies worth billions gave me the strength to\nbelieve in myself.\n\nThe co-founder of Heights, Dan Murray-Serter, is the reason I’ve taken time out\nof my life to promote multi-vitamins. I trust him to produce the best product to\nboost mental health.\n\n🧠 Brain Care\nHeights release an abundance of free mental-health content: from its newsletters\nto the Brain Care\n[https://open.spotify.com/show/52Ik1Y6BuDBUcxPUaEHY9W?si=3a76be2509ea4ef9] \npodcast, which shares bite-sized actionable knowledge to improve your mental\nwell-being.\n\nEven Dan’s tweets improve my life.\n\n📉 Placebo\nThere’s very likely an element of placebo causing the positive effects of the\npills. \n\nBut even then, I count this as a positive.\n\nNo other company could create a placebo effect as strong as Heights – due to\ntheir consumer-first focus on mental well-being. Their brand possesses a\nholistic drive to help people live happier.\n\nFor example, the capsules are the sexiest I’ve ever seen.\n\nI noticed a positive effect within the first couple of days of taking the pills.\nEven if this was a placebo because of how they looked, their aesthetic is\nderived from a certain chemical and physical design and structure. It’s that\nparticular formulation that causes me to experience a qualitatively good time.\n\nIf I feel good, who’s to say it’s not “real”?\n\nI’m surprised these 2 tiny pills have made a significant impact on me. If your\nbrain is also tired of feeling crappy, then check out their website\n[https://www.yourheights.com/blog/health/what-is-braincare] yourself and sign up\nfor their free newsletter!\n\nPeace,\nAnchit x\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy this article?

It’s the best\nway to support me 😃\n\nWhen you download a pirated copy of the original Lion King (1994) from the\ninternet, you first download its metadata before downloading the actual contents\nof the file.\n\nMetadata describes the file you're downloading. It includes variables like its\nsize and file type. Your computer uses it for various functions like mapping the\nfile structure and calculating the required storage space.\n\nWe use metadata too.\n\nIf The Lion King (1994) will take too long to download, we don't waste our time;\nwe cancel the download and continue with our lives. Sure, it would have been\ngreat to watch The Lion King (1994), but the cost of waiting hours isn't\noutweighed by the benefit.\n\nSimilarly, in life, we have problems and meta-problems.\n\n🤔 Meta-problems\nWe possess this amazing ability of metacognition - we can think about thinking. \n\nFor every problem, we can consider the underlying meta-problems. These describe\nthe problem’s type, size, and the importance of a solution.\n\nFor example, I used to suffer from the problem of feeling like I'd wasted 6\nyears of medical school because I'm didn’t wish to pursue a traditional medical\ncareer.\n\nThis problem festered existential anxiety in me; I felt guilty that I've thrown\naway a portion of my life and I used to spend a lot of time trying to reconcile\nthe issue.

Ruminating\nover the problem is harming my mental health; I've already spent a long time\nthinking about it and I'm nowhere near a solution; and, at the end of it - the\nsolution doesn’t make a difference to my current happiness.\n\nMaybe I find reconciliation in the knowledge that all past experiences are\nnecessary for who I am today.

The cost-benefit of\nsolving the problem is unfavourable compared to discarding it.\n\n👁‍🗨 The answers will come\nMany of these problems boil down to important meta-problems like our purpose in\nlife and what makes us happy.\n\nWe can set aside time for deep reflection, preventing problems from affecting\nour day-to-day joy. \n\nOver time, we are likely to discover tools to find answers as we learn more\nabout ourselves and life.

The privileged child living in London with the knowledge he could do so\n    much.\n\nKnowledge of opportunity is a double-edged sword: we can only pick one path,\nleaving us with the realisation there is so much we will never do.\n\nOur expectations become an ever-moving goal post.\n\nUnhappiness stems from a desire to change our current state. With the knowledge\nthat certain opportunities will make us happier in the future, we become unhappy\nin the present. It creates a void that we struggle to fill - our Happiness Gap\n[https://www.anchit.me/everyone-wants-to-be-happy/].\n\nMaybe we aren’t designed to know everything.\n\nPeace,\nAnchit x\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCool things I've come across this week:\n * 🔊 Alain de Botton on The True Hard Work of Love and Relationships (podcast)\n   \n   –\n   [https://open.spotify.com/episode/1HB8VzGvLefKxz7BlgUQwI?si=5f3fdd3e75a54547] \n   everything Alain says is great, including everything from his organisation\n   ‘The School of Life'.

Your approach should subdivide the nebulous problem into discrete ‘buckets’, where each bucket is completely different to the others, but collectively, all buckets cover all possible issues. For example, you can split “<em>falling profits</em>” into two MECE buckets: <em>Revenue </em>and <em>Expenses </em>(as profit = revenue - expenses).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d9653b0a0a8cf09a91eea17b545b23ff31f36c87467e0358d6e135d22a969302/687474703a2f2f696d6730372e64657669616e746172742e6e65742f363132322f692f323031342f3035312f352f632f6d65657365656b735f62795f6d69636861656c6f676963616c6d2d6437376130666c2e706e67\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"GitHub - cvetanov/meeseeks-get: I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

Make sure to subscribe and share with friends! It’s the best way to support me 😃\n\nI’ve been prepping for consultancy case interviews.\n\nIn these, you are asked something like “Company A wants more money to go brrrr - how can they do it?“ and you have 30 minutes to come up with a solid, airtight plan, on the fly. Or, as in a recent interview, “how many eggs are in the sky?”\n\nApproaching this without any mental models is difficult. How can you ensure your answer is logical, systematic and structured?\n\nThankfully, there are models to use!\n\nFundamental ones include the MECE framework (pronounced like Mr “MEESEEk”s) - Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive - and identifying root cause issues. Your approach should subdivide the nebulous problem into discrete ‘buckets’, where each bucket is completely different to the others, but collectively, all buckets cover all possible issues. For example, you can split “falling profits” into two MECE buckets: Revenue and Expenses (as profit = revenue - expenses).\n\nWhen consulting on one of life’s greatest problems - how to not suffer - the Buddha used a MECE approach, identifying the root cause issue.\n\nHis firm, Buddhism, is very popular.\n\nHis slide deck on the 'End Suffering Project' is entitled ‘The Four Noble Truths’.\n\nThese were his main points.\n\n\n😭 1. Dukkha\n\nSometimes, we suffer.\n\n\n😥 2. Samudaya\n\nThe cause of suffering?\n\nDesire.\n\nWe suffer when we:\n\n 1. Want something we don’t get: I want abs. Each day, I wake up without abs.\n 2. Get something we don’t want: I get colds. A lot of the time.\n\nDesire is a fire that burns an endless abyss of suffering into our lives.\n\nThe flame feeds on our infinite wants, deepening the void: I want respect; I don’t want to be poor; I want to be happy.\n\n\n🤔 3.

Magga\n\nThe way to end suffering is by following the Eight-Fold Path.\n\nUnfortunately, the specific details of the Eight-Fold Path require doing further work with his firm.\n\nIn a nutshell, instead of focusing on things outside our control (the things we get/don’t get), we focus on what we can control: desire itself.\n\nRemove desire, remove suffering.\n\nAlso, be fully mindful of the present moment, act by the values we preach, and be truly committed to kindness towards others.\n\n\n🐬 Love Yourz\n\nNirvana (sometimes interpreted as \"blown out\") refers to extinguishing desire.1\n\nA state without suffering or dissatisfaction; existence in pure bliss.\n\nAs another wise philosopher once said:\n\n“Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got\nAlways gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the one's you rock\nAlways gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours\nBut you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours\n\nNo such thing as a life that's better than yours (love yours)”\n\n- Love Yourz by J Cole\n\n1. Obviously, I can’t reduce the true meaning of Nirvana to a few words.\n\nPeace,\nAnchit x\n\n\nCool things I've come across this week:\n\n * 🔊 The Tim Ferris Show with Dr Matthew Walker on All Things Sleep (modality) – another deep dive into ways to improve sleep including techniques like “sleep divorces”.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542744173-8e7e53415bb0?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxjb25zdWx0aW5nfGVufDB8fHx8MTY3NTk3OTgwOQ&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-02-09T21:53:04.000Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T22:13:02.000Z","published_at":"2023-02-09T22:13:02.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6271011e6924a00031072614","lexical":null},{"id":"641592c633f15c003d48862b","uuid":"c262216a-db89-4788-af80-c30027a6e30c","title":"What is love?","slug":"filipa","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"email\",{\"html\":\"<p><strong><em>Dear Fil,</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>I hope you have the best, most incredible year.
