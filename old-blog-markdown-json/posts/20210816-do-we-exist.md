**Hello friends üíô**

üéá Do we exist?
==============

Probably not.

But the real question is: **does it matter**?

üñ• Simulation Theory
===================

Recently, the ***Simulation Theory*** has gained a lot of traction. This is the argument we are most likely living in a **simulation** rather than **'base reality'**.

This theory is supported by the exponential increase of technological capabilities. In the space of about 50 years, we‚Äôve gone from games like **Pong** to **Bone Works VR**.

Extrapolating forwards **10, 000 years**, we will reach the point where ‚ÄòVirtual Reality‚Äô is **indistinguishable** from ‚ÄòReal Reality‚Äô.

=================

**Nick Bostrom**, a philosopher, has postulated 3 eventualities:

1. Civilisations **never reach** the point of simulating reality due to **extinction** from **natural disasters** or **wars**.
2. Civilisations that do reach this point have **no interest** in simulating reality
3. Civilisations reach this point and have an interest in simulating reality.

I need to believe the **human race will not kill itself**; the alternative removes any point in living.

Moreover, **humans** (at least in current culture) **enjoy playing God**: consider the popularity of the Sims game.

Therefore, **‚Äòtrue life simulations‚Äô are an inevitability**. These simulations may even be powerful enough to start creating their own simulations.

The probability we exist in base reality ‚Äì rather than one of the numerous simulations within simulations ‚Äì is **tiny**.

üòø Quantum Non-determinism
=========================

The Simulation Theory is a helpful explanation for observed phenomena ‚Äì namely, **quantum non-determinism**.

You‚Äôve probably heard of the **Schr√∂dinger's Cat** thought experiment: the cat is ***both* alive and dead**.

It only exists in a determined state once **observed**.

In computer games, the majority of the level remains unloaded to make efficient use of limited resources. Rendering areas all areas is wasteful if the player can‚Äôt interact with them.

Under the pessimistic assumption that technology *always* has a limited capability to render all of reality, the **Simulation Theory** helps explain why the cat *‚Äòisn‚Äôt loaded‚Äô* until a *‚Äòplayer‚Äô* interacts with it.

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So what?
=============

Pondering *whether* we live in a simulation is the **easy part** ‚Äì we will eventually find out whether we do or do not.

The next problem is far more interesting: what do we do if we **are** in a simulation?

If you found out now that you‚Äôre a bunch of **1s and 0s** being played with on a **child‚Äôs sub-par computer**, would you consider yourself not real?

You **feel** that *you* exist ‚Äì is this quale the same as ‚Äòexisting‚Äô, regardless of what physically generates that feeling?


> **I think therefore I am**.  
> - *Ren√© Descartes*

‚õè Do we have free will?
=======================

The creator of our program, relative to us mere simulated mortals, would be **all-powerful** and **omnipresent**.

Others describe such an entity as ‚ÄòGod‚Äô.

If we exist in a program, are our actions pre-determined by them? **Do any of our choices matter**?

I would say, **yes**.

Otherwise, **life has no meaning**.

‚öî We matter
===========

Regardless of the truth, we **have** to believe our actions matter; that the goal of making the lives of ourselves and those around us better **is possible**.

Pre-determinism and a lack of free will is a **pathetic cop-out** for those who wish to validate second-class actions. Instead, our **privilege should be utilised to enact positive change**.

We each hold a **social duty** towards our fellow human beings. It is down to us to fulfil it.

Live this **game** exactly how you wish.

But do so with **purposeful responsibility** rather than **defeatist acceptance**.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [üìö Storyworthy](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Storyworthy.html?id=ZoRZDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) - started a new book about how to improve your storytelling and why it matters.
* [üîä Do we have specific Personality Types? (Not Overthinking)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Hf2HoZFSRDPVYMqGK1dP6?si=oQwTCXhhRfqbYX_2evCO6g&dl_branch=1) - podcast about personality types (which, along with learning styles, I fully do not believe exist, mainly because of the mountains of data suggesting otherwise)
* [üìΩ VSauce analysis of Mind Field episodes](https://youtu.be/b0cakXwiZ8s) - VSauce has been one of my favourite content producers since I was a child. Here, he first discusses treating childhood mental illness through placebo and the ethics behind lying to them for their benefit. He also considers whether we **should** die, given we have the ability to indefinitely elongate life through cryogenic storage.
