**Hello friends 💙**
-------------------

**Newton’s First Law** states that moving things will keep moving, and still things will remain still.

It’s a good explanation for the phenomena of ***behavioural inertia***.

🏋️‍♂️ Habits are hard to make and break
=======================================

When you’ve developed a bad habit, it is very hard to change direction. Additionally, it’s difficult to generate a healthier habit.

This is another example of why we [must rely on discipline instead of motivation](__GHOST_URL__/motivationisamyth/). Due to **behavioural inertia**, habits will keep occurring and it’s rare that we will feel the urge to change.

Starting a new habit can be **gruelling**.

Your mind and body are so used to the old life, that trying to overcome the inertia becomes a **monumental feat**. It will remove all remnants of motivation once held.

This is why we need to **treat ourselves like we would our children**.

👶 Treat yourself like a child
=============================

Children get told how to live their life and do many things they don’t want to: sleep early, eat vegetables, and study. 

They don’t want to do those behaviours in the moment because they don’t *feel* like doing it. But considering the long-term, rational perspective, it’s crucial they follow those routines.

They’re made to do it **regardless** of how they feel.

👁 Future You is watching
========================

Do things not because **Present You** gets instant satisfaction, but instead to improve the life of **Future You**.

Future You is looking back at the *fleeting mirage* that is Present You.

Be sure to impress them.

Peace,
