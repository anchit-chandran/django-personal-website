**Hello friends 💙**
===================

Hate from others can upset our **peace**.

It usually makes me **angry**.

Actions fuelled by anger are **rarely** in my best interest.

It’s certainly possible to become a *‘Zen monk’* who isn’t perturbed by others’ opinions – thereby, not reacting regrettably. 

Unfortunately, this takes a **lot** of work to achieve.

In the meantime, I’ve decided to learn better ways to deal with **insults**.

🤔 Is it true?
=============

When insulted, we should **pause to consider if it is true**.

If it *is* true, there is no reason to be upset.

When people call me short, it’s wasteful to be disturbed by something **self-evident**.

I’m not bothered by my hair being black; why should I be dismayed by another feature **completely out of my control**?

👨‍🏫 Who are they?
=================

**Who is the person insulting me?** Are they respectable?

If I *do* respect their critical opinions – like my hockey coach or drum teacher – then I’d be silly to respond to their assessment with hurt feelings.

Conversely, I should be ***relieved*** when someone I detest makes disparaging remarks.

Their disapproval of my way of living is a very positive sign: it means I **must** be doing the right thing! In fact, I would be significantly *more worried* if they thoroughly rated my actions.

👶 Babies will cry
=================

People who insult you with petty words can be considered **overgrown children**.

During my Paeds A&E placement, a very sweet 4-year-old asked me “Why are you so dark?”.

Getting upset would have been ridiculous.

Similarly, these **adult-children** don’t deserve our anger; they don’t know any better.

Genuinely trying to cause someone harm, for no good reason, suggests deeply flawed character traits.

We should hold pity for these individuals, not harbour anger.

🐶 Dogs will bark
================

There’s a **dog** that barks at me on my daily journey to secure an **iced mocha** from Pret.

When it barks, I make a mental note of the fact the dog seems to not be my biggest fan.

However, I’d be strange to *get angry,* allowing it to ruin the rest of my day by thinking, “**Oh no** – that **dog** doesn’t like me!”

If being mean is within someone’s nature, note it and treat them like any other **barking dog**.

😡 Acceptance
============

As the great Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, suggests, we should start each day **accepting** the fact we will encounter people with whom we disagree.

These people *will* be **annoying, deceitful**, and **dumb**.

Clearly, this is because *they* don’t know **true virtue** as *we* do: *they* live in their own [echo chamber](__GHOST_URL__/2-tearing-down-my-echo-chamber/).

However, we should remember we all have our own lived experiences.

We should try to not be truly hurt by others: they’re usually unaware of why their actions are so bad.

Moreover, we should think about [understanding their life's qualia](__GHOST_URL__/4-considering-the-qualia-of-human-life/) before making harsh judgements as an **eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind**.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:

* 🎥 [Never Have I Ever](https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=80179190) - Netflix series that completely normalises being brown. Also, it's by the don **Mindy Kaling** (who also wrote the jokes for the US Office!). Season 2 just dropped!
