**Hello friends 💙**
===================

I like my daily iced Mochas from Pret.

***Why?***

Well, I bought the **subscription.** I like that it’s a **cooling drink**. Most importantly, I **need** caffeine.

***Why?***

Caffeine lets me be **productive**.

***So?***

Productivity allows me to achieve the **goals** and **values** I’ve set myself.

***Why do they matter?***

They let me be a **good person** for myself and others.

***Why be good?***

Being good is the **best** way to live.

***Why?***

*There’s no objective reason.*

🖤 Nihilism
==========

For everything we believe important, with depressingly few numbers of **“why?”**s, this same conclusion is always reached.

We are **homogeneous concentrations of energy**, perched on the surface of a **mundane** rock, hurtling through the **endless void** of space.

As **monkeys** with opposable thumbs, we have conquered **land**, **sea** and **air**. **Space** is our next frontier.

And yet, the human race exists unaware of the **insignificance** of our mortality. We stand on the precipice of **multiple** extinction-level events. 

**None** of this matters.

‘**Good**’ and ‘**bad**’ do not fundamentally exist.

😥 Nothing matters
=================

To clarify, this includes *both* the **best** things and the **worst** things. In the grand scheme of our uncaring universe, *nothing objectively matters*.

My desires? **Meaningless**.

My values? **Meaningless**.

My pain? *Especially* **meaningless**.

All I know for certain is that **I don’t matter**.

Attempting to fight this fundamental truth is a **Sisyphean undertaking**.

😁 Nothing matters!
==================

Though I sometimes ascribe to pessimism, I don’t wish this for others.

Consider the optimistic view of **Nihilism**: it’s a *freeing* belief.

It is *because* nothing matters that you can live your best life, with “best” decided upon by yourself.

💃 Life is a dance
=================

The fight against **barren purposelessness** creates **fun**.

Whether we win or lose, the only important thing is deciding to **continue** fighting.

**Life is a dance**.

We don’t dance to reach the other side.

We dance for the sake of dancing; for the **beauty** and **joy** it evokes; to enjoy it whilst doing it.

**Don’t stop dancing**.

Peace,  
Anchit x

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* 📽 **[The Mathematics of Love](https://www.ted.com/talks/hannah_fry_the_mathematics_of_love?language=en)** - love doesn’t exist but this is a fun video.
* 📽 [**Parks and Recreation**](https://www.netflix.com/watch/70143842?source=35) - meaningless joy and happiness.
* 📱 [**The Real Depression Project**](https://www.instagram.com/realdepressionproject/?hl=en) – if you want to better understand a loved one struggling with mental health problems, and how to better help them, this is one of the best pages I’ve ever come across. Notably, they have a daily newsletter for actionable improvements to beat depression.
