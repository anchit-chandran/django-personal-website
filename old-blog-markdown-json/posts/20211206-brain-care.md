**Hello friends 💙**
-------------------

Disclaimer: this isn’t sponsored (lol I *wish* I could make money from this), I genuinely love these multi-vitamin pills and think they will help others.

🔅 Heights
=========

The start-up, *Heights*, have developed a **Smart Supplement** – a multi-vitamin pill designed for optimum brain nutrition.

*“Why am I reading about a multi-vitamin review”* I hear you exclaim… Well, it’s more than the pills but let me tell you about them first.

💊 Smart Supplement
==================

Using evidence-based research, **Heights deliver everything your brain requires in 2 capsules** taken every day.

You *could* spend your money on Amazon’s cheapest option, but those companies are driven by one thing: **profit**. They cut corners to optimise production, at the cost of your brain health, to increase their bottom line. They are the reason multi-vitamins are largely useless.

**Why do you need supplements for your brain?**

Sure, not everyone does. You could already be getting all the vitamins you need (according to research for long-term brain health and preventing cognitive decline) from your diet which includes:

1. *Green, leafy vegetables 5x a week*
2. *5+ different coloured fruits and vegetables every day.*
3. *Berries 5x a week.*
4. *5+ servings of nuts a week*
5. *Olive oil 5x a week*
6. *Whole grains 5x a week*
7. *Oily fish 2x a week or take an algae-based omega 3 supplement*
8. *Legumes and pulses 5x a week*
9. *White meat/mix of plant-based proteins 2x a week*
10. *Vitamin D supplement*
11. *Minimal processed foods*
12. *No more than 1 glass of wine a day*
13. *1-2x coffee or tea a day max*
14. *2L water a day*

This would be impossible for me to keep consistent – and if we're not consistent, there’s no point.

Thankfully, Heights have solved the issue by condensing all the benefits above into their capsules. They have made the habit formation aspect frictionless which is crucial because consistency is the number one thing that will make improve your brain health.

And you *need* a healthy brain to do more and live a happy life.

🦸‍♂️ Dan Murray-Serter
======================

I’ve listened to this podcast, [The Secret Leaders](https://open.spotify.com/show/2IwIk50zNhVsgK0rQRSik7?si=5d225493644d4615), for a long time. 

I always thought the host, *Dan Murray-Serter*, had a unique way of connecting with others and humanising business.

One day, he spoke about mental health explicitly – both his own journey and the experiences of other CEOs.

In the past, mental health was taboo. I felt lonely and terrified I couldn’t be successful if I suffered from any problems.

Listening to my dude talk so freely about mental health with these people earning millions and running companies worth billions gave me the strength to believe in myself.

The co-founder of Heights, Dan Murray-Serter, is the reason I’ve taken time out of my life to promote multi-vitamins. I trust him to produce the best product to boost mental health.

🧠 Brain Care
============

Heights release an abundance of free mental-health content: from its newsletters to the [Brain Care](https://open.spotify.com/show/52Ik1Y6BuDBUcxPUaEHY9W?si=3a76be2509ea4ef9) podcast, which shares bite-sized actionable knowledge to improve your mental well-being.

Even Dan’s tweets improve my life.

📉 Placebo
=========

There’s very likely an element of placebo causing the positive effects of the pills. 

But even then, I count this as a positive.

No other company could create a placebo effect as strong as Heights – due to their consumer-first focus on mental well-being. Their brand possesses a holistic drive to help people live happier.

For example, the capsules are the **sexiest** I’ve ever seen.

I noticed a positive effect within the first couple of days of taking the pills. Even if this was a placebo because of how they looked, their aesthetic is derived from a certain chemical and physical design and structure. It’s that particular formulation that causes me to experience a qualitatively **good time**.

If I feel good, who’s to say it’s not “real”?

I’m surprised these 2 tiny pills have made a significant impact on me. If your brain is also tired of feeling crappy, then check out their [website](https://www.yourheights.com/blog/health/what-is-braincare) yourself and sign up for their free newsletter!

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* **[📺 Community *(TV Series)* –](https://www.netflix.com/watch/70155589?source=35)** hands down the best sitcom ever released.
* **[🔊 Nish Kumar on *Hip Hop Saved my Life with Romesh Ranganathan (podcast)* –](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TOjpoh6HG1f5B1ZuUxGEQ?si=GyxwV4glTwaxzrl1za_c1A)** Two brown kings speaking about life, interspersed with some classic hip-hop. Though I’ve always found Nish funny, he’s very SJW with his humour. Didn’t realise he got so much hate for it.
* **[🔊 Finding balance in a dopamine overloaded world with Dr Anna Lembke *(podcast)* –](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1wFTluZ2odM2IQ8PBEkiBA?si=6aa6287d22bc4fb2)** the host of this podcast, Dr Rangan Chatterjee, is who I want to be in my life in terms of medicine. This episode talks about how addiction (to anything, including caffeine) leads to depression and how to overcome it.
* **[📲 Cointracker.io *(app/website)* –](https://www.cointracker.io/)** lets you connect all your various crypto wallets to visualise in one dashboard. For example, as of 04/12/21 09:09 GMT, I am in a 6.57% loss 😎
