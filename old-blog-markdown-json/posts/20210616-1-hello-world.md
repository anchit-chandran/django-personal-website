**Hello friends ðŸ’™**
===================

On **14th May 2019**, I uploaded my [*first vlog*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Anchit&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=D3tPaKW7edI) to YouTube, which is currently on *16k* views.

Back then, the **medic social media hustle** wasnâ€™t completely saturated. Video editing was quite fun and I wanted to show Imperial in a realistic and positive light.

I didnâ€™t consider the consequences of uploading content to the internet. I hadnâ€™t expected the backlash I got from some friends and peers. As an insecure child, I took this personally, becoming embarrassed of the project Iâ€™d spent months working on. I considered removing it.

Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t. Surprisingly, the majority of positive feedback came from people on the internet - mostly freshers who recognised me in person, saying theyâ€™d enjoyed the video. I regret not continuing vlogging as Iâ€™m a firm believer in:


> *Itâ€™s not timing the market, itâ€™s time in the market.*

Maybe if I had continued, I could have grown a large platform to make side-hustle money from productivity videos on SkillShare.

**Why am I starting a weekly email? ðŸ¤”**
---------------------------------------

If youâ€™ve spent more than 10 minutes around me recently, youâ€™ve probably heard me speak about Ali Abdaalâ€™s podcast: **Not Overthinking**. He has conversations about productivity, human interaction, and life purpose. Ali is a big proponent of making your creations public - particularly through a **weekly email**.

I have a lot of nebulous goals to improve the world, but few are properly formed. Iâ€™ve found verbalising and discussing ideas with others is the best to solidify concepts.

A weekly email allows others to consider my ramblings, engage and teach me about their own views. Particularly regarding topics like mental health, Iâ€™ve found openly talking about my experiences de-stigmatises the area and allows others to speak about their own struggles.

**F\*\*k the h8rs ðŸ”¥**
---------------------

Iâ€™ve spent enough of my life allowing insecurities to hold me back.

One of my biggest insecurities is what others might think of me, particularly those I know. Iâ€™m starting to overcome this by realising:

1. People spend very little time thinking about others - weâ€™re far too busy worrying about ourselves.
2. If I imagine one of my friends doing this, I would be very supportive - thereâ€™s no rational reason to not assume the same of them.

**Sitting in the discomfort ðŸ˜¬**
-------------------------------

As a wise man (Yash) once told me, you should **sit in the discomfort**.

We only improve when uncomfortable and making my thoughts public seems *very* uncomfortable.

One of my life goals is to improve the NHS. I am hoping to do this by reforming its systems through improved organisational culture and technology. System redesign first requires an understanding of those systems. I can understand by starting conversations with people.

A newsletter each week should take relatively little time. However, incremental gains over a large amount of time lead to exponential success. Iâ€™m excited to keep a record of how my patterns of thinking change in the future.

Thanks for taking the time to read this! Either hit reply or message me directly if you want to discuss anything!

Peace,
