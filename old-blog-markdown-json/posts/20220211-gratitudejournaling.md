Every day, I force myself to find something for which I’m grateful.

I’ve been doing *gratitude journalling* for around a year now because I kept reading it’s one of the most effective tools for combatting depression.

It can be done in many different ways. I’ve personally found that writing a few words every day works best for me and my schedule.

🖋 Why it’s worth doing
======================

There’s a lot of positive psychology literature regarding the benefits of gratitude journaling.

It feels uncomfortable at first - like any new habit. 

But it gets easier over time. Increasing numbers of neural pathways are created which decrease the effort required to find and feel gratitude in our lives.

Each moment spent feeling grateful carves out a larger path. The likelihood to choose a positive mindset, regardless of the situation, increases.

🌊 Ease the pain of bad days
===========================

Gratitude journaling is very easy when you have a fun day.

However, those entries are simply practise for our worst days.

I’ve learned the most from times when everything goes wrong; when gratitude *seems* impossible.

As I’ve forced myself to write at least *something* each day, I *have to* look deeper.

I wrote very basic things like “my health” or “the sun”.

In the beginning, I didn’t actually feel grateful; I was just writing something down when I got to the end of the day. This got quite effortful: I had to overcome the activation energy every night, right before bed, to consider about what I’m grateful.

So, because I’m lazy, I started thinking about what I could write down earlier in the day.

I noticed myself finding gratitude even in unpleasant situations, because I remembered I’ve written an entire list of the great things in my life. 

The more I wrote, the longer, and more meaningful, the list became.

⏲ Make it a habit
=================

The habit formation part is crucial.

The subtle, yet beneficial bleed-through effects of gratitude only seep into daily life after a decent amount of commitment. For this reason, I made it as simple as possible to keep doing it: I just needed to write one word.

Each time we are grateful, we cast votes for a new identity. Instead of thinking of gratitudes because we have to, we become someone who is grateful.

It’s still easy to get wound up over petty things but we can catch ourselves more often.

I’d recommend it to anyone who’s looking for reasons to enjoy life!

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [**📽 The Joker *(film)* –**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Joker-Joaquin-Phoenix/dp/B07YP8JS6J)​ a cool exploration of Nietzschean philosophy but imo Fight Club did it much better.
