**Hello friends 💙**

There is a voice inside your head reading these words.

You can’t stop it from speaking but you can notice there *is* a voice.

If you can *notice* the voice, then who does the voice belong to?

🕳 Thinking Traps
================

CBT teaches about **thinking traps**. 

These are unhelpful patterns of thinking which contribute towards low mood.

For example, we may find ourselves placing a ‘**Mental Filter**’ over our experience by only paying attention to certain types of evidence: *noticing our failures but never seeing our successes*. We may ‘**Catastrophise**’ by blowing small things out of proportion: *one low grade means you are a failure*. We may attempt to ‘**Mind Read**’ by *assuming we know what others are thinking, leading to unwarranted feelings of anxiety and embarrassment*.

The underlying assumption behind escaping these traps is that we *can* notice those thoughts when they come.

🧠 Separating thoughts and You
=============================

There are the thoughts and there is You, the observer of thoughts. 

To **observe** thoughts, we must be **separate** from thoughts.

The realisation there **is** a voice in your head can be one’s first spiritual awakening. This powerfully profound knowledge makes it easier to catch ourselves going down avenues of negative thoughts which cause psychological self-harm.

🎭 Our inner voice is a little bitch
===================================

The self-talk hurts us.

Something unfortunate happens, and we think “*I deserve this*”. A person is a dick, but we think “*Of course, I’m worthless*”. Someone annoys us because “*well, obviously - they’re evil*”.

Separation from that voice regains agency over our life.

It forms the foundation of the maxim: “*you choose to be happy*”.

Unfortunately, this is often touted by Toxic Positivity Pricks without explanation, and without adequate nuance. It's a solution to chronic dissatisfaction but doesn't solve acute problems.

🛌 Waking up and staying awake
=============================

*Waking up* in spirituality refers to becoming conscious of one’s life. You look back at how you used to live like a dream - where the events made sense at the time, but are nonsensical now.

It’s the first step in a journey that should never end. There is nothing special about it - one just becomes conscious of what was already known.

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* **[🔊 The Daily Stoic: Psychotherapist Terri Cole on saying No and setting healthy boundaries](https://open.spotify.com/episode/71ada69i4HPreC9rTxkEC5?si=334fc471f29d4d23)*****[(podcast)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/71ada69i4HPreC9rTxkEC5?si=334fc471f29d4d23)*** **[–](https://open.spotify.com/episode/71ada69i4HPreC9rTxkEC5?si=334fc471f29d4d23)** my favourite word is 'no'. I drop people who drain me. FOMO has turned into *Joy*OMO. This is all because saying no means saying yes to the people I care about and spending more time doing stuff that makes life worth living.
* **[🔊 On Purpose with Jay Shetty: Will Smith on owning your truth  *(podcast)* –](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1A3sjeBKf5qHjQ1VQgJO3t?si=ae0e885889574665)** good craicc by Will Smith, discusses a bunch of interesting topics including the Bhagavad Gita.
* [**🔊 On Purpose with Jay Shetty:Matthew McConaughey on turning barriers into green lights  *(podcast)* –**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6Uk89hHDZxQ6pur2kCGa9S?si=be46ed79270145fc)McConaughey talks about excellent parenting advice: let children make mistakes, and get hurt (as long as it's not harmful) so they can actually learn about life.
