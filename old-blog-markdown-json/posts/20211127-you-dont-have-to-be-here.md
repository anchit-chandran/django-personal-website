*T/w – references suicide*

**Hello friends 💙**
===================

Medical school placements are often awful.

Over an 8 hour day, only around 1 hour will be useful.

The rest is spent on commuting, waiting, or being in a clinic from which you’re gaining nothing.

My precious, limited life is being wasted.

I’m committing very slow suicide.

👍 Say no to say YES
===================

Contemplating death can guide us to live better such as **tomorrow is not promised**.

This lesson revolutionised how I live.

**A remembrance of mortality affords me the strength to say no** to wasted time because doing what you hate means *not* doing what you love.

Over the past 3 years, I’ve been forced to stay and waste away by someone only **once**. Even then, I spent my time on *petty ways* to ruin their day.

🌎 Do it for others
==================

Contemplating death in uncomfortable situations has taught me many lessons. Here’s an example:

**🖋 The Problem:** I get lazy and put off studying medicine. I don’t want to do it now and I can always do it another day.

**💭 The Contemplation:** I begin to ask myself *why* am I here and *why* I’m studying. Nothing is forcing me to study. Not studying will impact my medical career but again, I don’t *have* to be a doctor.

Taken to its logical conclusion, I don’t *have* to be alive. That’s not fun so first, I *choose* to live – my foundation for everything else. 

I’ve *chosen* to put effort into medicine because it’s one of the most effective ways I can improve society. That’s a nebulous, life-long goal that requires a plethora of minute steps. One of those steps is *choosing* to study because when the day comes that I need to deal with life-threatening anaphylaxis, I *must* know the treatment to fulfil my goal.

**🧘‍♂️ The Lesson:** I’m not studying for myself – I’m studying to help others. Even when I hate myself, it’s much easier to find the strength to help someone else.

☠ Use death to live
===================

I’ve been doing this to help me over the past few years.

I live by the maxim of “HELL YES or hell no”: either I want to do it (either in the short-term or long-term) or I’m *not* doing it.

I’m a lot happier because **death forces me to always live**.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [\*\*🔊 Ibn Khaldun – Economics in Ten *(podcast)* – \*\*](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2v7AAAawy0qCELKtW3mKNW?si=6c020dbb03b34b67)  Economics in 10 is a podcast hosted by these 2 heart-warming Econ teachers who explore the life and work of economists through 10 questions. This episode in particular fixed a gripe I have with Econ: it seems to all be based on works by old white men. Turns out, this don, born in 1332,  is the actual founding father of Economics (Adam Smith who??).
* **[🔊 What is the purpose of group holidays? – Not Overthinking](https://open.spotify.com/episode/23xP83qpJ3xsaaMARomPXr?si=7be73295af4c4b2a)** ***[(podcast)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/23xP83qpJ3xsaaMARomPXr?si=7be73295af4c4b2a)*****[–](https://open.spotify.com/episode/23xP83qpJ3xsaaMARomPXr?si=7be73295af4c4b2a)** one of the best podcasts for people who love over-thinking stuff. Loved this episode where 5 of Ali Abdaal’s mates chat about the dynamics of a group holiday, whilst in the middle of their group holiday.
* [**🔊 Secrets of Doing More with Less in a Digital World *(podcast)*** –](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5MrMCSbPrz3jQLGFKpqnIH?si=4c78cd8ef5cc4470) 4-hour Work Week is one of the books I’d gift the most (if I ever bought physical books) for people who don’t want to spend their best years wasted on working. This talk is Tim Ferris’ condensed version of important concepts from that book.
