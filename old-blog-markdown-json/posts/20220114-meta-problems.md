When you download a pirated copy of the original **Lion King (1994)** from the internet, you first download its **metadata** before downloading the actual contents of the file.

Metadata describes the file you're downloading. It includes variables like its size and file type. Your computer uses it for various functions like mapping the file structure and calculating the required storage space.

We use metadata too.

If The Lion King (1994) will take too long to download, we don't waste our time; we cancel the download and continue with our lives. Sure, it would have been great to watch The Lion King (1994), but the cost of waiting hours isn't outweighed by the benefit.

Similarly, in life, we have problems and ***meta*****-problems**.

ü§î Meta-problems
===============

We possess this amazing ability of **metacognition** - *we can think about thinking*. 

For every problem, we can consider the underlying **meta-problems**. These describe the problem‚Äôs type, size, and the importance of a solution.

For example, I used to suffer from the problem of feeling like I'd wasted 6 years of medical school because I'm didn‚Äôt wish to pursue a traditional medical career.

This problem festered existential anxiety in me; I felt guilty that I've thrown away a portion of my life and I used to spend a lot of time trying to reconcile the issue. What ***if*** I had done A, what ***if*** B doesn't pan out, what ***if*** C is better?

These unhelpful thought loops were making me *Not-Have-A-Good-Time*, so I considered the meta-problems.

üí† It‚Äôs not that deep, bro
=========================

**My problem**: the feeling of wasting 6 years of my life.

**My meta-problems** include: *how* is this problem affecting me; *how long* I may need to spend trying to find an answer; and ultimately: **does the problem matter right now**?

With self-reflection, the meta-problems provide an easier solution. Ruminating over the problem is harming my mental health; I've already spent a long time thinking about it and I'm nowhere near a solution; and, at the end of it - the solution *doesn‚Äôt make a difference to my current happiness*.

Maybe I find reconciliation in the knowledge that all past experiences are necessary for who I am today. Or I accept those years have been a waste. Regardless, I have to live and I want to be happy now. The cost-benefit of solving the problem is unfavourable compared to discarding it.

üëÅ‚Äçüó® The answers will come
=========================

Many of these problems boil down to important meta-problems like our purpose in life and what makes us happy.

We can set aside time for deep reflection, preventing problems from affecting our day-to-day joy. 

Over time, we are likely to discover tools to find answers as we learn more about ourselves and life. We can seek comfort that every unpleasant thought we have has plagued humanity since its birth, and an old white dude has definitely written an essay on it.

Meta-problems have allowed me to see my problems from a more productive perspective. They have relieved anxiety because I've realised that many of my issues don't matter, meaning I can spend more time on those that do.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [üîä The Diary of a CEO with Steven Bartlett: Jordan Peterson](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5JIWn94njRec6183RH8hs6?si=e6b3338ff8b448fc) *[(podcast)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5JIWn94njRec6183RH8hs6?si=e6b3338ff8b448fc)* [‚Äì](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5JIWn94njRec6183RH8hs6?si=e6b3338ff8b448fc)recently, Molly Mae made an arse of herself claiming that we all have the same 24 hours in a day so poor people should try not wasting their time. This was unfortunate for her, but very fortunate for me because I discovered the fantastic podcast on which she said it. Regardless of your opinion on Jordan Peterson, I'd recommend listening to this episode about living your best life and despair. There are also great ones with Jimmy Carr and Russell Howard.
