Hello friends 💙
===============

To the great detriment of my mental health, I refused to engage in **Eastern mindful practices** growing up. They were associated with the *Instagram-obsessed, frappuccino-consuming,* *gap yah* **coloniser**.

Looking back, this perception is **disgusting**. 

However, the North wasn't very receptive to brown boys connecting with their roots.

I was blind to how **divine** and **sacred** these methods were.

I didn’t realise my ancestors crafted them over generations to **learn to accept and love oneself**; to fight the inner demons everyone will face. They are some of our most effective tools to psychologically survive a consumerist, capitalistsociety.

***Science agrees.***

[An overview of 26 systematic literature reviews](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29306938/) found **clearly significant improvements** using **mindfulness meditation** in the treatment of **depression**, **long-term illness**, and **psychological well-being**. 

*Cognitive Behavioural Therapy*, the NHS’ most cost-effective psychiatric treatment, relies heavily on this same ancient wisdom.

🦓 Pretend you're a believer for 5 minutes
=========================================

Everyone should discover the benefits for themselves.

Even if you are the most **rational**, **anti-religious, non-*****WooWoo*** person (*as I used to be*), drop your biases and ***pretend*** this article is legit until the end.

**If none of it connects, that’s fine** – you’ve validated your beliefs by testing them under scrutiny.

People naturally discover these practices when losing the will to live.

**Many do not.**

At the very least, you'll be aware of a potential tool for yourself or your loved ones when the day comes.

**Unfortunately, that day will come.**

🧘‍♀️ Breathe in, breathe out
============================

Focus **entirely** on your breath for **10 seconds**.

Breathe in and out deeply, ensuring you think about **nothing** aside from your breath.

Forget about any stress and anxiety. You have the rest of the day to worry.

Just **concentrate** on your breath for **10 seconds**.

This may feel easy, especially if you’ve never engaged in mindful practice. But you are likely unaware of infiltrating thoughts.

The more you meditate, the more you realise how difficult it is to quiet the **anxious mind**.

We spend the majority of our lives **thinking without being aware we are thinking**.

🌑 Mindless thinking
===================

Where do your **thoughts** come from?

When I try to watch for my next thought, it’s like watching a film.

Each new thought is another scene.

They come from **nowhere**, magically appearing in my **conscious experience,** similar to how it feels different experiencing rainy vs sunny weather.

The problem with mindless thinking begins when we **identify ourselves** with these thoughts.

🔏 The mind prison
=================

On a daily basis, someone annoys me.

My autonomic nervous system startles into a **fight or flight response**: my blood pressure rises, my heart rate increases and my pupils dilate.

A fraction of a second later, I become conscious of these changes, and identify the affective experience: **"I feel angry"**.

The feeling of anger launches a string of **Negative Automatic Thoughts** (NATs). These NATs loop around my mind and **add weight** to the anger.

I think that *I am* angry because I’ve *identified* with my NATs.

**I believe *my thoughts* are *me***.

I become a mindless zombie controlled by thoughts I didn’t choose. Mymind **subjugates** me to my environment, holding me hostage**.**

Depression and anxiety begin to fester.

🏊‍♂️ You’re the swimmer, not the river
======================================

**Thoughts flow like a river** – ever-changing and continuous, moving of their own accord.

We can believe we *are* the river because *we* move in the same direction.

In reality, **we** are **the swimmer** being carried along. 

**We exist** **entirely separate from the water** which bathes our conscious experience. 

**Mindfulness** is about waking up and becoming **aware** we are the *person*, not the *river*.

Utilising this over time, one can craft a **boat**. 

Boats still follow the current but it’s **far clearer you’re separate** once you **escape** the water. It’s also easier to **change direction** in a boat.

Death, dreams and DMT are the rare times you **permanently** step onto land and begin a different journey.

🌌 Your are not your thoughts
============================

Regular punctuation of your day with **mindfulness** reminds you of an empowering truth: **you are not your thoughts**.

Anxiety and depression can be **overwhelming**. 

In these times, try to **fully be aware of the feeling** without judgement. 

Where is it located in the body? Does it move anywhere? What is its nature? 

Shining your conscious flashlight onto the depression/anxietyhelps you realise **the feeling is a part of you** – not the other way round. 

Becoming the ***feeler*** *of depression,* rather than the***depressed*** *feeler,* strips power from the illness*.* 

You transcend from a *passive receiver* to **The Active Noticer.**

🏃‍♀️ Mindfulness ≠ meditation
=============================

Mindfulness doesn’t have to be sitting in hours for silence. You should find something that works well with your schedule.

Though it's probably the most direct way to separating yourself from unhelpful thoughts,  I rarely meditate now because of time constraints.

The goal of mindful practice is simply **conscious awareness** and **focus on something aside from your worries**. 

It can be achieved in many ways such as yoga, exercise or prayer.

Anything that gets you out of your head will work! 

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* 📲 [**Down Dog (guided yoga) is free for NHS Staff**](https://www.downdogapp.com/healthcare)*(app) –* Down Dog is my favourite app for yoga – it's much better than any YouTube tutorial by a white woman who's done a 3-week yoga course. Didn't realise it was free again when you sign up with your NHS email! Until January 2022.
* ❓ This wasn’t cool but I didn't know how to react and would appreciate your thoughts. This week, I was taking a history from an elderly patient and asked about recreational drug use. She replied, *“Oh… no. I kind of regret not trying it. I feel sad I’ve missed that part of life…”*. I had no idea how to reply – being "professional" prevented me from replying ‘*you’re never too old for drugs; you have so much life still to experience; psychedelic use has been shown effective for end of life acceptance etc.*’ Why is this unprofessional? Medicine, above all, is a practice to improve people’s health and well-being. If this comes through empirically safe and beneficial recreational drug use → why can we *not* recommend it?
* **🔊 [Psychiatrist speaks about pain and addiction](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Be4tuggcybyb0T28zuEoy?si=e3cb7d656be44fd3)** *(podcast)* – Psychiatrist Dr Lembke speaks about how our pain and pleasure centres are co-located in our brains, leading to their linking. She also suggests that those people who form an addiction (usually due to emotional-focussed coping) because of the loss of pleasure in their life (i.e. anhedonia) could utilise *painful* activities to balance out their pain-pleasure centre e.g. doing something difficult & outside one’s comfort zone physically and/or mentally (like martial arts).
* 📺 **[Dear White People](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80095698?source=35)** *(Netflix TV-series) –* new season!
* **🎁 [Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earphones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B088KTG9SM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)** *(product)*– my Beats X broke so got some new earphones and these are perfect for exercising/ generally on the go and synergise well with Apple products. Way better than Airpods.
