By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:

* Demonstrate ability to take in user input and integrate this within the program
* Utilise f-strings to print messages using variables
* Understand basics of the if/else statement
* Apply knowledge of syntax, variables, and control flow to **create your first Electronic Health Record**!

What is this?
=============

I have made a '*Coding for Medics*' tutorial series to teach the core concepts of programming all within a medical context. These tutorials should hopefully give you a strong foundational insight into how to code and its application within healthcare!

My tutorials focus on the '**Python**' üêç programming language. 

This is a free-to-use, open-source, high-level (complicated bits abstracted away so you can just focus on using it to make things) language that can create almost anything! Particularly, it's widely used in **data science** and **Machine Learning**.

Please get in touch if you have any questions!
