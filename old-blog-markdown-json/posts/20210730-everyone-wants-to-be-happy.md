**Hello friends 💙**
===================

In Year 11, **I wasn’t happy**.

The solution: **build my own computer** because it would give me so much freedom.

That was the **only** thing stopping my happiness.

Once I built it, **life would be okay**.

💻 Building my computer
======================

When all the parts arrived, I was **ecstatic**.

Within a few hours, I turned my computer on and its blue LEDs shone brightly. Over the coming days and weeks, I was finally **happy**. I could play the latest games, learn about things, and generally live my best life.

Unfortunately, the excitement faded away. Something was missing.

I started wanting **more** than *just a computer*: **I wanted to get into medical school**.

Once I got there, **life would be okay.**

🩺 Getting into medical school
=============================

Getting accepted to study medicine at Imperial is still one of the happiest moments of my life.

I was **ecstatic**.

It felt like my entire life had been leading up to that moment. For months afterwards, I was **happy**.

But again, **my happiness waned**.

I was living the **dream** of 16-year-old Anchit and yet, at the beginning of my second year, I took it for granted.

Something else was still missing; I realised I had a new goal: **becoming a doctor**.

Then, my **life would be okay**.

👨‍⚕️ Becoming a doctor
======================

Five years later, I’m **almost** there.

However, I fear the same pattern will repeat.

Once I graduate from medical school, **I will be ecstatic**.

But despite how fulfilling medicine is, I’ll eventually get used to it.

Like my computer and medical school, **my happiness will wane**.

I’ll need something else to fill the void because only then **life would be okay**.

🕳 The Happiness Gap
===================

The difference between my **happiness now** and the **happiness I want** is my **Happiness Gap**.

There are two ways to eradicate the Gap:

### 1. Living for the future

I can keep trying to improve my current situation and hope that **life would be okay** once I achieve all my dreams.

Though possible, my experience so far suggests it's **unlikely**.

Regardless of whether it *might* work later, it still means suffering now. 

That sounds **depressing** and **I don’t like depression**.

### 2. Living for the present

Alternatively, I could try being happier with the **current circumstance**.

This is easier said than done but luckily better people than myself have developed ways to be happy right **now** (*aside from MDMA*).

One technique I’ve enjoyed is **negative visualisation**: thinking about losing possessions (e.g. my phone, my wealth, my loved ones), to encourage gratitude for their existence.

I’ve found it **powerful** in reclaiming **joy**.

🚱 Being someone else
====================

One example of **negative visualisation** is imagining you lived the life of someone **less fortunate**: without food, water, or shelter.

By reframing our reference for happiness, we become **grateful** for these **basic amenities**. It creates **delight** in the **mundane**.

My life, even with all my woes, is **already** someone else’s **dream life**.

This may sound similar to: “*be grateful, there are starving kids in India*”.

By itself, that notion doesn't truly resonate with me because **I don’t find meaning in simply surviving**. Though it’s still important to develop gratitude towards the basics, **I need more to live a happy and fulfilling life**.

💙 Love
======

We privileged few worry a lot about finding the **perfect partner**. 

Many **important** features are considered like **status**, **career**, and **appearance**.

Imagine trying to find the perfect partner but **also** not having access to safe drinking water. One may need to travel miles carrying heavy gallons of **barely drinkable water**.

In this instance, we don’t have the **luxury** to seriously consider a potential partner’s **superficial qualities**. Instead, we must first consider their **size** from a **survival aspect**: a larger person requires more water, which is more difficult.

The freedom to choose our partners according to the most minute details, which don’t really matter, makes them **far more** **special**. 

***We*** **chose** ***them***, rather than **external circumstances** dictating who we ***have*** to date.

Recognising the freedoms afforded to me even in the **intangible** helped me start becoming **happier**.

☯ Choosing to be happy
======================

There are times I’ve **hated** medical school.

We get **boring** placements in **ugly** hospitals with **nasty** teams. Even the commute becomes **depressing**.

This year, I’ve attempted to make an effort in seeing the positives. I **chose** to study medicine so I **have** to be present, even if it’s a bit meh.

If I’ve chosen to do something, it’s **wasteful to lament** when I could **choose joy** instead. It’s essential to find positives because **what's the alternative?**

**Suffering**.

This mindset also gives me the strength to **actively minimise negatives** (like becoming confident about leaving useless clinics and speaking out against consultant bullying).

Negative visualisation reminded me how **lucky** I am to attend even the worst placements because I was still **learning to save lives at one of the best medical schools in the world**.

I owe it to little Anchit to **choose** to be **happy**.

Peace,  
Anchit x

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* 💙 My **NEGATIVE** Rona test 😎
* 🎥 [**Fight Club**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) (film) - one of my favourite films but when rewatching it this week, I started appreciating the deep Nietzschean philosophy. **Phenomenal** piece of art.
* 📚 [**Guts**](https://onlinereadfreenovel.com/chuck-palahniuk/33843-guts.html) (short story) - **Chuck Palahniuk** is the author of 'Fight Club'. He's written this short story. Very few words can cause a physiological *fight or flight response* in me but this piece has made the list. I can't spoil it for you so I'll just say:
1. it's **NSFW** (*not safe for work, children, parents etc.)*
2. it's only **6 pages**

 **If you do read it, please let me know how it made you feel.**
