**Hello friends 💙**
===================

Orthodox religious people should not practise medicine.

Religious **dogma** interrupts our four *prima facie* fundamentals of **autonomy**, **beneficence**, **non-maleficence**, and **justice**.

Doctors could fail patients due to personal beliefs regarding issues like **abortion** and **safe sex**.

These **contradict** scientific evidence leading to harm.

Science is *not* **racist**, **sexist**, nor **discriminatory**.

It is **pure**.

Or is it?

‍👩‍⚕️ Medicine is magic
=======================

When a stroke patient presents, I will prescribe **Alteplase** and **Aspirin**.

This will **save** their lives.

But how do I *know* this?

Like the vast majority of my medical knowledge, it’s because **someone told me it works**.

How do **they** know it?

Possibly, some of their knowledge originates from **primary research**.

But even their majority comes from *their* seniors telling them it works.

Science relies on **trust** and **belief** that others truly know the truth, *and* they will accurately tell you the truth.

It’s **nonsensical** to make medical students discover the best treatment for every disease.

Unfortunately, this also presents a problem.

🐶 Dogma
=======

In religion, believers rely on **scholarly priests** to *translate* the **truth** for them.

In science, believers rely on **scholarly scientists** to *translate* the **truth** for them.

To this very day, **science** – *the bastion of logical rationality and progress* – **stinks** **of its own dogmatic biases**.

**We still learn racist, biased medicine** and forget to question it because we assume everything we are told is true.

Modern healthcare fails BAME patients because it was born with an unfortunate congenital condition: **colonialism**.

Colonialism has metastasised its **dogmatic beliefs** and hidden within the most fundamental aspects of medicine like **kidney function** and **pain tolerance**.

Until stuff gets really bad, this **cancer** remains untreated.

Overcoming this **failure** is the responsibility of every doctor.

⚔ Nothing is true
=================

Though science shares the faults of religion, it holds one major advantage: **the scientific method**.

In Abrahamic religions (e.g. Judaism, Islam, Christianity), the **ground truth** is the *revealed word of God*.

This **cannot** be questioned.

The *scientific method* stipulates ***there is no ground truth***.

![Assassin’s Creed Quote | 200](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/946203347142963138/245FE3DBB384C193516911D59862397DD5995D17/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false)Nothing is true, everything is permitted.*🧪 Nullius in Verba*
====================

Science is still a *dogmatic religion* built upon the belief that its core axioms allow reality to be understood.

But the **scientific method** sets science apart.

It follows the principle of ***nullius in verba*** – *to not take another’s word for it*.

If one deeply cares about a particular topic, their core assumptions can be **analysed under scrutiny** and **updated** accordingly.

Current society will never reach **universal prosperity** if its dogmatic separation of ideals continues.

Science and religion are conversations about the **same topic** held in **different languages**.

To strive towards a better world, **dogma requires excision**.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* **💻** [**The Universe is Hostile to Computers (Veritasium)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaZ_RSt0KP8) – quite a worrying but mind-blowing YouTube video.
* **🔊** [**The Bias Diagnosis (Ivan Beckley)**](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Bias-Diagnosis-Podcast/B08W4YZT2S#:~:text=Five%20patients%2C%20one%20treatment%20room%2C%20and%20a%20broken%20healthcare%20system.&text=But%20he's%20not%20convinced%20that,insidious%20injustices%20in%20modern%20medicine.) – a five-part podcast created by a final year UCL medical student exploring the hidden biases in medicine that fail patients. It includes personal accounts and it’s quite eye-opening.
