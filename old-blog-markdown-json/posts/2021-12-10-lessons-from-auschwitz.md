**Hello friends ðŸ’™**
===================

Iâ€™ve started reading this book, **The Choice**, by Dr Edith Eger. She is a world-renowned psychologist who treats patients with PTSD.

She is also a Holocaust survivor who had her parents incinerated on arrival at Auschwitz when she was 16 years old. The book is part memoir, part life lessons born from the necessity to survive against the worst of humanity. These relate to a philosophy I hold dear: 


> **When it rains, you can sulk or you can dance. Regardless, it will rain.**

I couldnâ€™t do the lessons justice Â â€“ you should read it yourself, but the following is an excerpt from early on.

ðŸŒ¤ Prison of your mind
=====================

**"**Whether youâ€™re in the dawn or noon or late evening of your life, whether youâ€™ve seen deep suffering or are only just beginning to encounter struggle, whether youâ€™re falling in love for the first time or losing your life partner to old age, whether youâ€™re healing from a life-altering event or in search of some little adjustments that could bring more joy to your life, I would love to help you discover how to escape the concentration camp of your mind and become the person you were meant to be. 

I would love to help you experience freedom from the past, freedom from failures and fears, freedom from anger and mistakes, freedom from regret and unresolved griefâ€”and the freedom to enjoy the full, rich feast of life. 

We cannot choose to have a life free of hurt. But we can choose to be free, to escape the past, no matter what befalls us, and to embrace the possible. 

I invite you to make the choice to be free.**"**

Peace,
