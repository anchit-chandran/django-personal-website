**Hello friends 💙**
-------------------

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is our most cost-effective treatment for multitudes of maladies, including psychiatric disorders.

It frees people from patterns of repetitive negative thoughts and harmful behaviours. One core principle is that **people already possess the strength to overcome their suffering** – they just need to reframe their worldview.

The founders of CBT, a practice designed to regain pleasure in those who’ve forgotten it, describe **Stoicism** as providing the “philosophical origins”.

This philosophy has helped slaves and prisoners of war find joy in life. It’s empowered the most powerful people in the world, whilst ensuring they remain good.

It requires no belief nor dogma; it’s simply a guidebook imbued with ancient wisdom which gives answers to difficult situations. 

🤔 How to *actually* live a good life
====================================

Many philosophies waste time on superfluous academia – questioning *what* we are, what *good* is, and what *life* is.

The Stoics said **Eudaimonia** (*the state of good spirit, of human flourishing, of happiness*) is reached by living a morally virtuous life.

Stoicism is about *practical* solutions to living a good life: not wasting time pondering meta-questions whilst people suffer. It deals with the acute before addressing the chronic.


> “Vain is the word of a philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man. For just as there is no profit in medicine if it does not expel the diseases of the body, so there is no profit in philosophy either, if it does not expel the suffering of the mind.”  
> **-** **Epicurus**

I see the Stoic answer to happiness as three-fold:

1. **Live in accordance with nature**
2. **Understand our locus of control**
3. **Fulfill our social duty**

🙅‍♀️ I’m already living a good life
===================================

One could plod along with life without assessing the journey because everything is already going well.

But without taking a step back to look at the bigger picture – how could we ever know we’re headed towards a favourable destination?

If we are unaware, our reactions to situations are based on emotions. This behaviour is akin to animals but we don’t have to live life this way. Stoicism teaches us to hold close what makes us human: our **rationality**. It reminds us that we have the power to control how we respond and behave.

It teaches how to maximise pleasure and minimise suffering: a *good* life.

🌦 Happiness is a choice
=======================

***We*** cause the majority of our suffering by the narratives we tell ourselves.

Judgement is assigned in an attempt to make sense of the world. But it is useless to be happy or angry at the world because **the world doesn’t care**.

Once we accept life unfolds as it wishes – hurling both pleasure and suffering at us – we can be free. We should enjoy wealth and comfort when they exist; fools cast these aside. However, too strong of an attachment will cause suffering when they disappear.


> *"Be the user, not the slave, of the gifts of fortune."*

Similarly, by placing oneself into a victim’s mindset, we self-subjugate. People, events, and things aren’t inherently good or bad, they just *are*.


> “A man who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary.”  
> **- Seneca**

**⛓ Locus of Control**
======================

One way to achieve freedom is to understand [we control very little](__GHOST_URL__/5/).

Recently, I didn’t get an award. I was dismayed. The feeling was normal at first.

But it kept playing on my mind, leading to more self-inflicted suffering. I don’t want to waste my life feeling shit so I took a step back to analyse the situation.

First, I accepted and acknowledged the emotions (sadness and anger). This is the most important step – Stoicism doesn’t advocate telling a person on fire they should be grateful for the warmth. Next, I identified that these emotions could be clouding my perception and leading to unhelpful reactions.

I held a false perception of reality and got upset when life went another way. My victim-identification was perpetuating the cycle of negative thoughts. Freedom came from true acceptance of the many unknown factors out of my control. Considering the alternative (on-going lamenting over stuff that won’t change), I had to update my beliefs and continue my life.

**🌍 Social Duty**
=================

The Stoics were all high-performers: **Seneca** was a playwright and investment banker; **Agiatis** was a powerful Spartan Queen, and **Marcus Aurelius** was one of the most powerful people in the world. 

Some lived in the worst circumstances: **Epictetus** was a slave; **Victor Frankl** and **Edith Eger** both lived through the Holocaust; and **James Stockdale** was a Prisoner-of-War.

Despite their situations, all learned to understand themselves to help others, preventing the *best minds of our generation waste away in pestilence and starvation*.

We have an uncountable number of blessings.

These privileges required some hard work but the vast majority came from pure luck – through circumstances of our birth and events outside our control. Opposing views are fed by the [lie of meritocracy](__GHOST_URL__/death-to-meritocracy/).

Stoic philosophy believes we should utilise our fortunate privilege to allow others to live a good life.

💥 Live your best life
=====================

Stoicism provides ways to better appreciate pleasures, discover more pleasures, and decrease suffering entirely.

You don’t have to believe in anything – all benefits are discovered through experimentation (by applying techniques in life and seeing if they benefit). Its conclusions stem from rational logic and investigation of your psyche. It requires little time to be set aside for stuff like meditation, whose benefits are realised only through consistent practice. Instead, it synergises modern, busy lives.

**Stoicism empowers you to live your best life**.

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* 📚 Happy by Derren Brown *(book)* – started listening to the audiobook version of this, narrated by Derren’s delicious voice. It explores many philosophies, particularly Stoicism, to find answers on how to live happier and why things might not be so bad.
* [🔊 How to talk to children about race – Feel better, live more *(podcast)*  –](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1aVbWCOyICVvYVDC7BDiRQ?si=870581451b30440d) there’s a part that resonated with me where Dr Chatterjee talks about the difficulties of having to form two different identities when he was younger – the ‘Indian’ one and the ‘British’ one.
* [🔊 How to transform your health through breathing – Feel better, live more *(podcast)* –](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7diN4LfWJccWaHRh6Zo1k1?si=38c1ab8ab3ec45b3) there are so many gems in this episode, these are just some that I particularly rated:
* Western medicine prevents death, Eastern medicine improves life – both are required and a balance is best
* Nose breathing is very good for health, mouth breathing is seriously dangerous
* Mouth tape when sleeping (I've been doing this for about a year and recommend it a lot)
* Breathwork – I’ve always been a sceptic but the dude on Rangan’s show is also a sceptic who’s explored all the different methods and found empirical benefit. Made me try this ([20 minute guided Wim Hoff methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ)) and I can see the benefit!
