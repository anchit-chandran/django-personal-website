**Hello friends ðŸ’™**
===================

Think about the last time you drank a **glass of water**.

How was it?

ðŸš° Glass of water philosophies
=============================

For something so mundane, thereâ€™s a surprising number of philosophies that refer to glasses of water. 

**Optimists** and **pessimists** focus on how full the glass is. 

**Solipsists** question whether the glass exists.

And then there are **Stoics** and **Buddhists** who are glad to simply possess the glass.

ðŸŒŠ Mindful gratitude
===================

Under this lens, we can be **thankful** for the work put in by kind humans to get water flowing in our taps, and for those who created the vessel itself.

We can be **mindful** of all the effort that went into extracting the water; the filtering and purification; the development of the network of pipes that allow us to access a life necessity simply by turning a tap.

We can **marvel** at the exquisite beauty of the glass itself. 

Itâ€™s transparent, allowing us to see the contents. Itâ€™s inert, so doesnâ€™t affect the taste of the liquid. It's been created with such an intricate design, just to serve us water.

â˜¯ Find happiness
================

Of course, you donâ€™t *have* to practise mindful gratitude.

But doing so helps increase the pleasure derived from even the most basic amenities. 

It reminds us **joy is a matter of perspective** and can be found within almost all circumstances.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* **[ðŸ“• The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Psychology_of_Money.html?id=TnrrDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y)** ***[(book)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Psychology_of_Money.html?id=TnrrDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y)*** **[â€“](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Psychology_of_Money.html?id=TnrrDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y)** being wealthy isnâ€™t just about what you know â€“ itâ€™s about how you behave. Financial decisions are irrational, based on our ego and unique experiences. This book explores our odd underlying beliefs and teaches you how to have a better perspective, and make stronger decisions to live a happier life.
* [**ðŸ”Š What is the purpose of a group holiday *(Not Overthinking podcast)* â€“**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/23xP83qpJ3xsaaMARomPXr?si=M1mW3YQURlKxohG7aL92bA) this is one of the most hyper-analytical, over-thought conversations Iâ€™ve ever listened to, and I loved every bit.
