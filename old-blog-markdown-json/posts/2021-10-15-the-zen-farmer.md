**Hello friends 💙**
===================

An old Zen farmer uses a **horse** to work his fields. One morning, the horse runs away.

All the villagers express their commiserations to the farmer, “*That’s sad! It’s just bad luck!*”

The farmer simply responds, “**Bad luck. Good luck. Who knows?**”

Bewildered, the villagers ignore him. After some weeks, the farmer toils away manually in the field. He hears the clacking of hooves and looks up – galloping towards him was not only his horse but an **entire herd of horses**.

The farmer now possessed **10 horses** to work his field.

All the villagers express their joy to the farmer, “*That’s great! It’s such good luck!*”

The farmer again responds, “**Bad luck. Good luck. Who knows?**”

Hearing his father could do with some help, the farmer’s son comes to visit. The son helps tame the new horses to work the field. Whilst doing this, one of the horses kicks the son’s leg, breaking it.

All the villagers express their commiserations, “*That’s sad! It’s just bad luck!*”

In response, the farmer replies, “**Bad luck. Good luck. Who knows?**”

A few weeks later, the son is still healing and unable to help his father. A group of army officers marches through the town, conscripting every young, able-bodied person to join. Upon seeing the son’s broken leg, they march straight past, leaving him to rest.

As usual, the villagers express their joy, “*That’s great! It’s such good luck!*”

The farmer replies, “**Bad luck. Good luck. Who knows?**”

🐎 Zen way to not give a fuck
============================

In life, **shit happens**.

Sometimes it’s what we planned and sometimes, it’s not.

We need to place everything into rigidly drawn categories of *Good Things* and *Bad Things*.

In reality, they are just **Things**. Until you live your entire life, you cannot know whether each Thing contributes to your life journey, or hampers it.

Don’t get me wrong, the Zen way of life doesn't condone becoming a **punching bag** for the evils in the world. Try all you can to ensure your plans work out, and when they eventually don’t, avoid being angry at the world because the **world doesn’t give a shit about you**.

Even Bad Things fuel the flame that is your best life.

🗣 Value judgements cause suffering
==================================

We all place value judgements on other people’s lives. 

We see something happen to them, compare it with our own **barometer of Good & Bad**, and decide whether this thing is Good or Bad.

As we all live unique lives, your value judgement is of little importance to another person. We shouldn’t tell others that their sufferings don’t matter because *we* don’t think them important. Relative to their past experiences and values, a Good Thing can be a Terrible Thing.

Understand how a Thing fits into that person’s life goals before expressing your opinion.

But ultimately, **remember to not give a fuck**.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [**🔊 Medical Cannabis 101 *(Big Picture Medicine, Podcast)*** –](https://open.spotify.com/episode/46TNRe2xshHdRG6PkKcEL4?si=702c63be5e4c4965) the GOAT that is Dr Sultan speaks with Dr Viaris de Lesegno, CMO of Cellen, this week about medical cannabis and its under-appreciated benefits. They also discuss advice for other *doctorpreneurs*.
* **💻** [**History of Psychedelic Drugs Policy by Professor David Nutt**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tknVVVGeDj0&t=3362s) *[**(Psychedelic Studies Imperial, Youtube)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tknVVVGeDj0&t=3362s)* – I recently discovered there’s a Psychedelic Studies society at Imperial and they are doing a series of talks exploring the current landscape of psychedelics. In this talk, the fantastic Professor Nutt gives an insight into the history of why Psychedelics got such a bad name, even though almost every single society grew using them. Learning about the influence of the government, pro-war propaganda, and counter-factual “science” seriously pissed me off. Definitely recommend watching!
