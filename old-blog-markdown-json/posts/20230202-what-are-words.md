**Hello friends 💙**
===================

I get bored and ask people questions like: “*what are words?*”

Why?

Sometimes, I like messing with people.

Sometimes, it’s to escape the monotonous conveyor-belt-to-nowhere script of conversation, otherwise termed “small talk”, through absurd humour.

But *sometimes*, there’s something more profound.

I usually find out by following the thought wherever it goes.

----------------

Think of a pink elephant, riding a snow-white unicorn with dazzling golden hair, sporting a yellow fedora, in line to pay for its groceries in Tesco.

You have an image in your head.

Just using words, I can telepathically transmit information to you.

Wow, words are pretty amazing.

Right?

💩 Words aren’t real
-------------------

Words do nothing more than label reality.

The word “spoon” doesn’t exist itself; it’s a pointer for an object in the real world.

And then you have words like “responsibility” which point to *stuff* in some *other* dimension.

Words themselves, like numbers, aren’t real.

So what’s the point of them?

🌌 Words model reality
---------------------

Words serve a useful purpose: they model existence. They’re a tool for sharing your experience of life with another person. And like all models, they’re imperfect.

They get pretty close to conveying your thoughts to someone else. But that’s it: at most, they get *close*.

They never encompass the entirety of meaning, and everyone has unique interpretations of different words. The meaning of the word “love” is different for you than it is for me.

Unsurprisingly, spiritual texts have a lot to say about words being a bit crap. For example:

1. **Pointing to the moon**: *imagine someone is trying to show you the moon by pointing it. The pointing finger guides to the moon. Do not mistake the finger for the moon* – there are lots of lessons to live a good life, but the goal isn’t the lessons themselves; the goal is to live a good life.
2. **Leaving the raft**: *you need to cross a large river. With great effort and time, you construct a raft. After you cross the river, would you still carry this heavy raft? No, it has served its purpose, so leave it* - words, thoughts, and ideas can be very beneficial – but once they’ve served their purpose, carrying them further would be burdensome. Leave them behind. Hold strong beliefs, loosely.

🤔 Words are words
-----------------

Why have I used all these words to describe the notion that words aren’t real?

I do not know.

Read between the lines to find real meaning or something.

Be more creative and free with your words and the fantastical paths they point towards.

Or be boring and ask “how’s the weather?”

Peace,
