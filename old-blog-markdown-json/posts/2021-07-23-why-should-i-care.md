Families are starving. 

Babies are suffering. 

Bees are dying.

Why should I care?

**Hello friends 💙**
-------------------

I came across this post the other day:


> *don’t go into medicine if you don’t care about social issues. how can you eliminate implicit bias without educating yourself? you can’t provide optimal healthcare w/o understanding the political, social, and economic structural disparities of patients from different backgrounds*  
> - **Tweet, author unknown**

Though it’s patronising and passive-aggressive, **I wholeheartedly agree**.

However, what I think is **irrelevant**.

The purpose of this article is to **change your mind** if you disagree. After reading my position, I’d love to hear your thoughts (**hit reply**)!

🏥 NHS treats disease not health
===============================

Medicine is a **necessary plaster** for ailments arising largely from **socioeconomic disparities**.

The **rich** rarely die **poorly** from disease.

They are far less likely to develop medical conditions due to **better health environments** from birth. Even for incurable maladies, they live a **higher quality of life** through more effective (and **expensive**) symptomatic treatment.

Considering an intersectional view, including race and gender, the combined socioeconomic impact on health **outweighs** any medical skill.

If we want to improve healthcare, we must understand social issues; not doing so is **willfully providing** **sub-optimal care**.

Improving the circumstances of children’s lives has a greater impact than anything I could accomplish myself through Paediatric medical practice.

**Dr Chattergee**, a doctor focussing on **holistic healthcare**, beautifully conveys this idea:

🤨 I don’t care
==============

I don’t care about **many** social issues.

Seeing as I love talking about improving health via social justice, this seems like major **cognitive dissonance**.

However, I hold good reasons for these two opposing thoughts.

🤗 What is caring?
=================

What does it mean to **actually** care about something?

I love a good **pseudo-sciencey explanation** so here’s my nerdy view.

How much we care can be approximated using a **continuous scale** from 1-10, with 10 being something we care about **deeply**.

Using this model, people sometimes assume that ***caring slightly*** (e.g. 1 out of 10) is ***synonymous with caring***.

That mindset converts our continuous scale to a discrete, binary one: **to care or not to care**.

This strikes me as a **false fabrication** as it reduces the bar for justice.

It’s the reason people post a **black square** on Instagram, make no real change, and continue singing the N-word in songs (can you tell I **despise** virtue signalling).

🔋 Caring is a finite resource
=============================

We may feel we “care” about **all** the tragedies in the world when in reality, this **can’t be true**.

If we aren’t well-educated on an issue, then we don’t care (as much as we believe).

Caring means **actively** possessing concern and interest. It means placing **importance** on an issue.

For something to be ***more* important**, there must exist other things which are ***less* important**.

We expend our finite “caring budget” towards those issues as we **care enough** to make active efforts. Though unfortunate, we ignore other evils as we can’t make a difference.

🌩 Too much caring is harmful
============================

**I don’t think** we should care deeply about absolutely everything.

One could choose to feel strong emotions towards all we encounter. Perhaps it’s even beneficial **initially**.

But we **will** end up **hurting** ourselves.

In medicine, it’s necessary to **detach** from our patients as we deal with the **fragility of mortality** daily.

We can only continue our job by **not** caring too deeply about those we treat. A high emotional investment leads to guilt, burnout and depression.

I only care **actively** towards matters I hold some personal connection, formed through my life experiences. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the honest fact that I don’t care much about many topics.

I **can’t** care about everything.

🦥 Complacency is dangerous
==========================

With this being said, the real danger lies in becoming **complacent** that we *can’t* care about everything.

For those who wish to leave the world better than they found it, more is required.

*Obviously*, I care about children dying in other countries.

However, with all the other things I care about, where I can make an actionable change, I may lump it into the **“would care but can’t care”** category and continue with my life.

**This isn’t good enough**.

By avoiding discomfort, I also **lack the motivation** to improve and educate myself.

We become satisfied that simply **holding values** such as “*no one should starve*” is adequate.

When we’re not aware we’re doing anything wrong, we have no desire to put it right.

We need to catch ourselves slackin’ before we can reform (a core tenet of CBT!).

✨ Step 1: admitting it
======================

A better mindset is to **admit** to ourselves that we do not care about a lot of things.

The ability to make a list of matters we don’t *currently* care enough about is beneficial: our **blind spot** (those things we don’t know we don’t know) is reduced and **targets** for self-improvement are identified.

🗣 Speak your audience’s language
================================

It’s equally important for stakeholders to provide a compelling reason ***as to why people should care***.

This is a **case-by-case** proposition. Matters like **systemic racism** become arduous to argue if you’re having to validate your **existence**.

When learning about a problem I care about deeply, I attempt to find ways to relate this problem to others. I try to convey the importance of **why they should care** as I’m aware there was a point in my life where I **also** did not care.

Communicating in the language of our audience is **crucial**.

For example, simply telling billionaires that “**climate change = bad**” is ineffective. It would be great to live in a world where **selfishness** didn’t overrule **compassion**, but **this is our reality**.

Instead, we can present the strong, multi-faceted business case for sustainability. Translated viewpoints are the best way to enact change.

It all starts by realising: **we don’t care**.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* 🦠 My positive Corona test
* 📜 This [article](https://t.co/1qR8oKEs7k) - found it in an enthralling [Twitter thread hole](https://twitter.com/heyibrah/status/1418220496450031617?s=21). The article is about how to write powerfully and each point is actionable. My main takeaways have been to try **removing adverbs** and omitting phrases like “I think, I believe, it seems” because they’re [hedges](__GHOST_URL__/3-no-more-hedging/).
* 📹 [New Amsterdam](https://www.amazon.com/New-Amsterdam-Season-3/dp/B08XVWZHDG) - fully one of my favourite TV shows that has some good medicine alongside exploring all the difficult human elements of being a doctor. Season 3 is out (in America)!
* 🎵 [We’re all alone in this together](https://open.spotify.com/album/6HwzIlrCDq3WF9vMq8meqG?si=SiN2VeoOSAGKwYOMkFo79w&dl_branch=1) - Dave just dropped a new album.
* 🎵 [Donda](https://g.co/kgs/Yhy2kb) - Kanye just dropped a new album.
