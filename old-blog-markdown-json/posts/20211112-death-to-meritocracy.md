**Hello friends 💙**
===================

You have worked hard in your life, therefore, you **deserve** everything you’ve earned.

Your success is a **just reward** for your intellectual capacity and effort.

Others have failed at every chance they were given. They’ve failed so many times, that one can no longer pretend: they don’t **deserve** to be at the top like you do.

This is a paraphrased section from the satirical 1958 book by Young, ‘*Rise of Meritocracy*’.

⚒ Success is earned
===================

**Meritocracy** is the idea that everyone is given an equal opportunity to receive what they put in – through innate ability or hard work. It’s a central assumption baked into numerous cultures.

Many people believe our society *is* meritocratic – that **grit** and **determination** are essential for improving one’s conditions.

In a [recent survey](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/unequal-britain.pdf), the British public was more likely to say those who lost their jobs during the pandemic were not unlucky: they **deserved** it. Almost **50%** think **poor performance** explains being fired. Less than 1/3 of people consider luck as a factor.

Of course, COVID-19 disproportionately affected those who worked the hardest, ***not*** us lucky neo-bourgeoise who lounged at our desks. Yet, we benefited the most.

The false meritocratic ideal makes people more **selfish**, less **self-critical** and more prone to **discriminating** against others.

👫 Meritocracy solves inequality
===============================

[*Castilla et al, 2010*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2189/asqu.2010.55.4.543) found companies who held meritocracy as a core value assigned greater rewards to **male** employees over **females**, despite **identical performance evaluations**. The discrimination was eliminated when meritocratic ideals were not explicitly held.

Meritocracy is weaponised by those who need logical reasoning for their subjugation of those less fortunate. It brainwashes the 99% to blindly believe that they can win the rat race with hard work.

Meritocracy is not only wrong; it’s **evil**.

💸 Meritocracy creates class mobility
====================================

Policies based on meritocratic ideals are **dangerous** and **idiotic**.

For example, one may think the **abolishment of selective schools**, including aptitude based, zero-fee grammar schools, would create a fairer society.

Regardless of *espoused equal opportunity*, privilege is implicitly baked into the success of the wealthy. Parents will pay for private tutors, prep test courses, and extra-curricular activities. 

Wealth **always** confers greater capacity to give your offspring an advantage over others. And with the removal of grammar schools, there is even less opportunity for class mobility.

Meritocracy could only exist in a **full-egalitarian** and **authoritarian** **communist** **society**.

🌎 Meritocracy benefits everyone
===============================

Meritocracy is the most **fellatory** distribution principle. It licenses the powerful rich to transmute their privilege into personal superiority.

Even basic things like being “money-savvy” and possessing “financial-literacy” for investing are meritocratic lies.

If you *can* invest, you should. But **not everyone can**.

I have the ability to burn £250 in a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme with almost no worry, but this could ruin someone else’s life. I don’t need to consider paying for rent or utilities myself. The lucky circumstances of my birth are a more significant factor allowing me to invest, rather than any inherent behaviours.

🦾 Death to meritocracy
======================

We must begin **recognising** our privilege as the opposite causes **vindictive apathy** towards those less fortunate.

Studies show that being self-aware and grateful for our successes, even whilst enjoying them, minimises the negativities associated with the meritocratic lie, leading to us becoming **better people**.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [**🔊 How to optimise your brain health (Deep Dive)**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4l2DK2bNRLa0BqIJXb28Tg?si=e50386d720cc4ff9) – my lord and saviour, Ali Abdaal, speaks with another of my heroes – Dan Murrary-Serter – about improving one’s own brain health. Also, Dan explains his understanding of spirituality to Ali, who doesn’t really know anything about it. Dan is the CEO of **Brain Care** who sell daily vitamins which are actually scientifically-backed. I’ve been taking them for 1.5 months, and I’d recommend them to everyone!
* **[📽 Narcos: Mexico Season 3 (Netflix)](https://www.netflix.com/title/80997085)** – New season of Narcos: Mexico released.
