**Hello friends 💙**
===================

***Myth: successful people are highly motivated.***

Motivation is **not** the common thread for the greatest people.

Learning this has significantly improved my mental health.

📈 Habits need activation energy
===============================

Our behaviours require some **activation energy** – the desire to actually start and complete an action.

Let’s take the example of me going to the **gym**.

This habit required me to first **think** about going to the gym, feel **motivated** to go, followed by **actually going**.

When the sum of ***Thinking*** and ***Motivation*** surpass the **activation energy**, the *bro gains* occur.

🤸‍♀️ Discipline not motivation
==============================

There’s an assumption that successful people are **inherently more motivated** to keep up habits that lead to greatness.

In reality, they’re just **disciplined**.

They’ve realised **Motivation** is dependent on uncontrollable external factors. 

However, their **Thoughts** are completely in their control.

Routines get completed **regardless** of whether one feels like it.

**Motivation** fluctuates but **discipline** does not.

🦾 Building better systems
=========================

A life-changing book, *Atomic Habits*, talks about the importance of **systems** when crafting habits.

*People* don’t fail, their *systems* do.

I’ve decided to form a habit of drinking water every morning. After all, **my body is a temple**.

### 🚫 Bad System

Before *Atomic Habits*, this was **hard**. It involved:

Waking up → going to the kitchen → getting a glass → filling water → drinking water → washing the glass → returning to my morning routine.

Each step required activation energy. **More steps mean more overall energy required**.

This was a **bad system**.

### ✅ Good System

After *Atomic Habits*, my routine became:

Waking up → drinking from a water bottle place next to the bed the previous night → returning to my morning routine.

As soon as I wake up, I only have to complete the **one action** I’m optimising for: **drinking water**. A single step requires **little** motivation, **decreasing** the required activation energy.

Other steps like going to another room and washing up were superfluous steps that **bloated** my system.

🧱 Habit Stacking
================

Another benefit of developing good systems is the concept of **habit stacking**.

Once a behaviour is strongly formed, you can ‘**stack**’ a new habit onto the previously existing one.

The old habit becomes the **cue** for the new one.

Every morning, I **moisturise my face**. This habit is **deeply ingrained** and happens on auto-pilot.

More recently, I’ve also started taking daily **Vitamin D** pills (*especially if you’re darker-skinned, get your vitamin D levels checked ± take 1000U daily!*).

Moisturising my face is the **cue**, which allows me to **always** take my pills.

🍎 Discipline = happier, healthier life
======================================

I am **rarely** motivated to do anything – studying, fitness or even activities that *should* be pleasurable.

Waiting for some **elusive** motivation meant I spent a lot of time **doing nothing**.

Now I rely on discipline and #ProductivityHacks to remain **high-functioning**; without these, I find my life to have **little meaning**.

Peace,
