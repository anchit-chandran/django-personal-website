Look at this straw.


![Image Description](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/2-refraction-in-a-glass-of-water-science-photo-library.jpg )


We see that the straw *teleports* towards the side when it enters the water. But we are *dubious* this reflects reality: **straws don’t teleport**.

Though our eyes deceive us, how can we check? We could hold the straw under the water, confirming that it does in fact *not* teleport.

Our sense of touch fixes the error derived from our fallible sense of sight.

But even our sense of touch is imperfect; place one hand in cold water, and the other in hot, and they will feel the same.

Worse still, not only can our senses be wrong, but the degree of wrong differs between people ([as we all experience different qualia](__GHOST_URL__/4-considering-the-qualia-of-human-life/)), between time and between places.

📖 Theory of Knowledge
=====================

**Epistemology** is devoted to understanding how we know what we know. It’s relevant to everything and forms the foundation of science.

The only truth is that we *never* experience reality as it truly exists.

If you deep this for a moment, it’s terrifying.

Our senses are the only input we have for the external; they’re not even that great. 

Are we walking blindfolded through a dark, potentially deadly forest?

☯ Internal and external
=======================

We don’t *just* use external sensory input to understand our world.

It gets mixed with the **internal**: our previous experience and theories. Our brains generate the most likely conclusion based on past evidence.

We understand the straw *probably* isn’t teleporting because we use our theories of light refraction and the laws of physics.

The external is filtered through our internal first and then becomes our human experience.

🎭 We see what we want to see
============================

Just as the external misconstrues reality, so too can the internal.

We can create a false narrative that fits our beliefs regardless of the truth. 

The external (e.g. a person behaving “badly”, according to our values) is catalysed by our internal (that is *so* like him, she *always* wants to annoy me, they are *such* a bad person), distorting both.

We rile ourselves up to make the situation appear worse than it is, alongside making ourselves feel worse, all to be right.

Our human experience suffers.

⚖ It's probably not that bad
============================

There are times when the ***opps***are out to harm us, but on the whole, this is rare. 

Most of the time, we wound ourselves.

We will never know the true reality - we can only create a sub-standard version of it.

It’s up to us to make it a pleasant one.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* **[🔊 Deep Dive: How productivity ruins your life with productivity expert Oliver Burkeman *(podcast)*](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7yCsfUppC0SMZPiVGnLAeQ?si=b5a4529c70774437) -** what a coincidence -- Ali Abdaal’s two most recent Deep Dive episodes (where he talks to leaders in their field about how they live life) are **1)** about to-do lists and **2)** with the author of the mental health book I recommended last week. In this episode, they talk about accepting you won’t be able to do everything in 24 hours, being happy about that, and finding ways to do just the most important thing.
* **[🔊 Deep Dive: A Psychologist’s Guide to a Meaningful Life with Dr Julie Smith *(podcast)*](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5zf3QjS60BofCEHHRe2RAs?si=47d9a6e8733249a9)-** Dr Smith talks about stuff from her new book and generally how to make life worth living.
* **[💻 My Portfolio Website](https://anchit.netlify.app/) -** finished the first draft of my coding portfolio website; coded from scratch and learned a lot about front-end web development!
