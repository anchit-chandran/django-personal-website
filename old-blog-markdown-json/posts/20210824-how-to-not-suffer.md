**Hello friends 💙**
===================

Why do we **suffer**?

Last week, I was unfortunate enough to get a Tesco shopping trolley whose front wheel was broken.

I *struggled* to push it around, trying to force it the way I wanted. I was **dissatisfied** with the fact I picked this awful trolley. 

The entire shopping trip, I **suffered**.

Acceptance of Fate
==================

The Eastern philosophies, particularly **Hinduism** and **Buddhism**, shed light on one cause of suffering: **Duhkha**.

**Duhkha** refers to the suffering caused by a **refusal to accept the Wheels of Fate**.

Nature does as Nature decides. 

We have **very little control** over external events. Trying to **resist** the natural flow is a **wasted effort**, and leads to **suffering**.

Many philosophies exist to overcome **Duhkha** and reach **enlightenment**; in this case, it means **wholly accepting life** for what it is.

As ever, people hold different views on how to conquer Duhkha. 

I prefer another solution: **Amor Fati**.

Love of Fate
============

Though I vibe Eastern philosophies, my greatest gripe is with this simple *acceptance* of fate.

I won’t be a **punching bag** for whichever **entity** spins the Wheels of Fate, as they seem **non-benevolent**.

Instead, I like to consider **all** events, both enjoyments and obstacles, as **fuel for the flame** which powers my life’s purpose.

In this way, one can appreciate even the bad times; to develop **Amor Fati** – a **love of fate**.

**Good times** can only be good **with reference** to **bad times**. One can be grateful for **both** as neither could exist without the other.

The ups and downs of life are **crucial** in forming the shape of the journey we travel.

**Until we die**.

Remembering death
=================

You *could* **die** by the end of this article.

Knowing your flame will soon be extinguished, how much more would you **appreciate** life? Does a reminder of your **mortality** lead to a newfound **savouring** of the **pleasure of existence**?

When I really don’t want to leave the comfort of my bed, I consider **Memento Mori** – a reminder that I too shall die. 

The boring ward round I *have to do* becomes the **last** boring ward round I ***get*** to do.

When I forget **Memento Mori**, I become absorbed by **Duhkha**.

I forget this is all **temporary**.

I forget that on my death bed, I could look back on my years filled with **regret**.

I forget to **live** rather than just **exist**.

As a wise woman once said:


> *“Feel the rain on your skin, no one else can feel it for you”*  
> - **Natasha Bedingfield**

Only **you** have been **blessed** with the sacred opportunity to experience **your** life.

As we *must* be us, we may as well enjoy it by **defeating** **suffering**, through a **love of fate**, and **remembering our mortality**.

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* 🔊 [Russell Brand speaking to Ben Shapiro](https://open.spotify.com/episode/24pVqci0zG07SpVpEPfyIz?si=b20ShpHKTuqcT2TiMFYhyA&dl_branch=1) – Shapiro is a dumb dumb but I really rate Russell and I think he sets a really good example of how to productively disagree with people who have completely opposing world views but also share some fundamental ideals.
* 📽 [Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay](app://obsidian.md/index.html) – ??? good film tho
