**Hello friends üíô**
===================

Imagine a **fruit**.

Don‚Äôt continue reading until you can picture one.

What colour and shape is it? 

What does it taste like?

How ripe is it? 

ü§î You don't control your thoughts
=================================

What made you think of that **particular fruit**?

You have some logical explanation: you‚Äôve recently eaten it, or interacted with it, or you just love thinking about that fruit.

But this story **is a complete fabrication**.

Thoughts appear of their own will. Your mind post-rationalises a story to give you the **illusion of free will** ‚Äì that you are the generator of your own thoughts. 

Neuro-imaging has shown even eerier findings: your brain makes decisions **before** you are consciously aware.

üëÅ What do you see?
==================

Look at the boxes below.

Read what you see from left to right.

![](__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/10/image.png)Read left to right. What do you see?You might read:

* **Box 1**: *5 4 1 3 2*
* **Box 2**: *The quick brown fox*
* **Box 3**: *A B C*

There‚Äôs no right answer but I wanted to highlight the fact the ‚Äú**13**‚Äù in **Box 1** is the exact same as the ‚Äú**B**‚Äù in **Box 3**.

Why might someone see the **same characters** and **conclude different meanings**?

üß† Priming
=========

Our thoughts aren‚Äôt **random**.

Your environment and experiences make you more likely to think certain thoughts.

The 3 Boxes example started with **numbers** in Box 1, followed by **words** in Box 2.

 The words can *prime* you into a **context of letters**, making it more likely you see letters in Box 3.

**Affective priming** is similar. 

When you are in a bad mood, you are *primed* to think negative thoughts, which create a **vicious cycle** of worsening your mood.

üì¶ You are a product of your environment
=======================================

**Negative** environments, surrounded by **negative** people, will make you a **negative** person.

Of course, it won‚Äôt be the only cause but it is *much harder* to remain **positive**.

**Negative affects** *prime* you to enter situations expecting the **worst**. 

Your mind actively looks for confirmation of the belief you are in a bad situation, **ignoring all positives**.

It‚Äôs like when you start looking for orange cars, you will see many more orangecars.

‚ùÑ Minds are fields of snow
==========================

Bad environments are **guaranteed** in life. You can learn to deal with them.

Problems arise when you are *always* in this environment.

Our minds are like a **field of fresh snow**.

As a thought emerges, we trample over the snow forming a **path**. 

The more we walk down that path, the **deeper** it becomes.

We are **more likely to keep walking this path**, ignoring alternatives.

A negative pattern of thoughts develop.

One ends up **believing** the worst, **seeking** the worst, and therefore, **finding** the worst.

You feel **helpless**, **hopeless**, and **worthless** ‚Äì also known as Beck‚Äôs Cognitive Triad, common in depression.

üçç You are just you
==================

Treating psychiatric disease is difficult due to **interconnected issues** in the patient‚Äôs biology, psychology, and social situation.

[Learning to become actively aware of one‚Äôs thoughts](__GHOST_URL__/why-meditate/) is the most effective, long-lasting method for living better.

Once aware your thoughts are not you, one can label thoughts as **inaccurate** or **unhelpful**. 

When in a bad mood, we can **combat** affective priming generating negative thoughts by **not** acting on them.

New paths are possible once you internalise you are not your thoughts.

**You** are not your *identity* or your *ego*.

**You** are just **you**.

Also, the correct fruit was **pineapple**.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [üîä Tim Ferris Show: How to take radical responsibility and reduce drama in your life](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3TsJ9yRlcUEu6N1z0OyTat?si=67588c4debd94b97) *[(podcast)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3TsJ9yRlcUEu6N1z0OyTat?si=67588c4debd94b97)* ‚Äì Tim speaks with Diana Chapman about a method to analyse the thoughts and beliefs causing your anxiety. She gives us a tool to deal with unnecessary "*drama"* e.g. she talks Tim through how to escape the anxiety associated with a recurrence of his depression, which in the past, made him come close to taking his own life.
