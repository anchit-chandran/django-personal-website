😟 Zeigarnik Effect
==================

The **Zeigarnik Effect** is our tendency to remember incomplete or interrupted tasks better than completed ones.

On the surface, this is great: we can ensure we get everything done. However, it often becomes a problem in two distinct ways:

1. **Task-switching**: split focus leads to decrease cognition
2. **Intrusive thoughts**: thinking about incomplete tasks prevents rest and recuperation

👥 Task-switching
================

Our first problem arises because thinking about remaining tasks requires cognitive processing power. 

Humans, unlike computers, are awful at task switching. 

Each focus shift disrupts the flow and makes it harder to concentrate on anything. For example, if you sit down to study, and *task-switch* to TikTok for a few seconds, it takes an average of **23 minutes** to regain your full attention, according to [Mark *et al,* (2008)](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf). 

Tasks get longer, harder, and are done at lower qualities. They become more stressful and we become more susceptible to burnout. 

Ultimately, **life is less fun**.

💭 Intrusive thoughts
====================

Our second problem is the inability to be present.

Imagine we plan to work from 9 am-5 pm.

Long after 5 pm, our incomplete tasks swirl around our minds. These lead to repetitive negative thoughts which interrupt relaxation time - including sleep, which is vital for functioning day-to-day.

There will always be things left to complete so how can we find relief?

👼 To-do list heaven
===================

A simple, yet highly effective way of achieving freedom: **write tasks down**.

There are multiple ways to make a **to-do list**:

* Pen and paper
* Notion (🤢)
* **Todoist** - an amazing app in which you can type to-do’s from your phone’s home screen like “Get groceries tomorrow” and it will automatically schedule and sync with your Google Calendar. I’ve always used the free plan but you can apparently get 2 months of Pro for free using [this link](https://todoist.com/r/anchit97123_torgfj).

Regardless of your choice, writing down things we have to do - *as soon as we think about them* - frees us from rumination.

Incomplete tasks no longer taunt us at the back of our mind, pulling us from current enjoyment.

🌞 Be present, be happy
======================

To-do lists, similar to journaling, ease anxiety through **mental separation**. 

At 6 pm, we can enjoy the present moment, comfortable in the knowledge that our tasks *will* be done at some point in the future, but needn't be stressed about right now. If you experience procrastination-related anxiety in any form, to-do lists could be a simple solution.

There’s a surprisingly large amount of content on how to *“to-do”* properly.

It seems odd at first, but if it improves your mood and allows you to be happy, it’s all worth it.

Peace,

Cool things I've come across this week:
=======================================

* [📕 Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before? - Julie Smith (book) --](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08YVS7L16/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) Dr Smith is an experienced clinical psychologist I've seen condensing many aspects of CBT and mindfulness into short-form TikToks. She holds a unique skill of using digestible metaphors to describe the qualia of mental dis-ease. If you’re like me and can’t yet afford therapy, a book like this is fantastic and (combined with **Atomic Habits**) gives an insight into the actionable lessons to regain mental health.
