# django-personal-website

A personal website made in Django, to replace my Ghost blog!

This website was made using Django and styled using Bootstrap5.

Initially, I had toyed around with various different static site generators. Finally, I'd settled on Jekyll and was developing my own custom theme from scratch. However, it was hard to achieve more complex customisations.

For this reason, I just moved to my Django website, hosting the server and database as my own CMS. Part of this was just another reason to further my understanding of Django!

It was also a nice excuse to learn about using Dockerising applications with Docker-Compose, alongside hosting projects using a Virtual Private Server.
